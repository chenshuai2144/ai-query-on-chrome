# Bug Report: Ant Design Pro Side Menu Width is Fixed at 256px

## Description

The side menu width in the latest version of Ant Design Pro is fixed at 256px, even if the `siderWidth` configuration is changed in `config/config.ts`. The issue is reproducible and can be observed in both the default settings and mix themes.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the latest version of Ant Design Pro in a development environment.
2. Open the `config/config.ts` file and change the `siderWidth` configuration to a different value.
3. Observe that the side menu width remains unchanged.
4. Open the `defaultSettings.ts` file and change the `siderWidth` configuration to a different value.
5. Observe that the side menu width remains unchanged.
6. Open the `app.tsx` file and modify the `layout` property in the `menu` prop to change the side menu width.
7. Observe that the side menu width remains unchanged.

## Expected Results

The side menu width should be responsive and adjust according to the value of the `siderWidth` configuration.

## Additional Information

The issue is present in both the default settings and mix themes. The issue is also present in the latest version of Ant Design Pro.

## Workaround

A workaround for this issue is to modify the `siderWidth` configuration in the `defaultSettings.ts` file or in the `app.tsx` file's `layout` property.
