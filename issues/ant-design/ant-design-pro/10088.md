Ant Design Pro's side menu width is fixed at 256px in the latest version, despite changes to the `siderWidth` configuration in `config/config.ts`. The issue is reproducible in both default and mix themes and can be resolved by modifying the `siderWidth` configuration in `defaultSettings.ts` or `app.tsx`'s `layout` property.
