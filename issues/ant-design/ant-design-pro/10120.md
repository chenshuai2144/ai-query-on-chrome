This part is missing in the doumentation:
https://pro.ant.design/docs/simple-model#dva-migration

If someone can provide a direction, I can work on a PR for this.

Hi! Has anyone figured this one out? We too have a lot of V4 models and we'd like to migrate them. If possible, not all at once. Thanks!

你仍然可以继续使用 dva 而不是迁移
