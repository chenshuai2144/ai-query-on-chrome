# 🧐[问题 | question] V5 using the dark theme from V4

Hello, I want to use the colors of the dark theme in Version 4. I have a switch button to switch between dark and light theme in my app. I am using the following token information for the layout, only the color of the header changes, the text colors and sidebar do not change.

```
const Settings: LayoutSettings & {
  pwa?: boolean;
  logo?: string;
} = {
  navTheme: 'dark',  // it just selects light and realDark. dark is unedefined
  colorPrimary: '#1890ff',
  layout: 'mix',
  contentWidth: 'Fluid',
  fixedHeader: false,
  fixSiderbar: true,
  colorWeak: false,
  title: 'Ant Design',
  pwa: false,
  logo: '/logo.png',
  iconfontUrl: '',
};
```

Since V5 does not have the dark theme in V4, the light theme can be set to the old color scheme by using the layout token. I am not developing on v5 at the moment because it is not stable yet, I will continue with the v5 theme when it becomes stable.

v5 theme use light and realDark theme.
