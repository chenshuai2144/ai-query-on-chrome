# 🐛 [BUG] Sider.defaultCollapsed behaves weirdly when Sider.breakpoint is set

When a Layout.Sider.breakpoint is set, Sider.defaultCollapsed is not respected on layouts triggered by the breakpoint. On medium and above breakpoints, the sider renders as collapsed but immediately opens instead of staying collapsed.
