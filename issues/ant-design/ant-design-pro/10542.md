# 🐛 [BUG] Sider.defaultCollapsed behaves weiredly when Sider.breakpoint is set

### 🐛 bug 描述

If a Layout.Sider.breakpoint is set, Layout.Sider.defaultCollapsed will not be respected at layouts triggered by the breakpoint. i.e. if `breakpoint="md"` is set on the Sider, then on medium and above breakpoints the sider will render as collapsed but immediately open instead of staying collapsed.

### 📷 复现步骤 | Recurrence steps

1. Set breakpoint to a value
2. Set defaultCollpased to `true`
3. handle onCollapse to update Collapsed state
4. render sider on screen size where breakpoint is triggered

### 🏞 期望结果 | Expected results

If defaultCollapsed is `true` I would expect the sider to default to collapsed on all screen sizes. But with a breakpoint set, it still defaults to open on some sizes
