When using Ant Design Pro + Umi4 in a project with layout mix and multi-tab modes, clicking on the top-level tab and switching it may cause issues such as displaying the wrong page or unable to switch routes. Redirects for the top-level tab's path are not supported, leading to an empty tab page being displayed. It is recommended to avoid using multi-tabs.
