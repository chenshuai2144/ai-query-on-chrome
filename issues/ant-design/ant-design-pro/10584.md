To set the base border radius for your React project using Ant Design, try customizing the `@border-radius-base` theme variable in your `config/config.ts` file. If it doesn't work, make sure you are using a version of Ant Design that supports theme customization, and check that the variable is a valid one. You can find more information in the Ant Design documentation and the Umi.js documentation.
