It looks like the issue you are experiencing is related to the migration of Ant Design Pro v5. The built-in LESS variables are not working as expected because the `antd` package has been updated to use a different version of LESS. To resolve this issue, you can try using the `antd-pro-less` package instead of the `antd` package in your project.
To use the `antd-pro-less` package, you can install it by running the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install @ant-design/pro-less
```

Then, you can import the `antd-pro-less` package in your `less` file and use the built-in LESS variables provided by the package. Here is an example of how to import the `antd-pro-less` package and use the `@primary-color` variable:

```less
@import "~antd-pro-less/dist/antd-pro.less";
@primary-color: #d82b7b;
```

In this example, the `antd-pro-less` package is imported and the `@primary-color` variable is overridden with the value `#d82b7b`.
I hope this helps resolve the issue you are experiencing. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.
