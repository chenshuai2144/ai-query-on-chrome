To resolve an issue with Ant Design Pro v5's built-in LESS variables, try using the `antd-pro-less` package instead of the `antd` package. Install `antd-pro-less` by running `npm install @ant-design/pro-less` in your project directory. Import the package in your `less` file and use its built-in variables.
