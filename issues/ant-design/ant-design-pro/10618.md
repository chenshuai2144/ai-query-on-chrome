To ensure that both ProLayout and Ant components use the same theme, you can use the `theme` prop of ProLayout and set it to the same value as the theme of the Ant components you are using.
For example, if you want to use the `dark` theme for both ProLayout and Ant components, you can set the `theme` prop of ProLayout to `dark` like this:

```jsx
import ProLayout from "@ant-design/pro-layout";
import { Menu } from "antd";

<ProLayout
  theme="dark"
  // ...
>
  <Menu theme="dark" />
  {/* your content */}
</ProLayout>;
```

You can also use the `token` prop of ProLayout to customize the theme for specific components. For example, to set the theme for the `Menu` component to `dark`, you can use the `token` prop like this:

```jsx
import ProLayout from "@ant-design/pro-layout";
import { Menu } from "antd";

<ProLayout
  token={{
    colorTextMenuSelected: '#fff',
    colorTextMenu: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.75)',
    colorTextMenuTitle: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.95)',
    colorTextMenuActive: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.95)',
    colorTextSubMenuSelected: '#fff',
    colorMenuBackground: '#004FD9',
    colorBgMenuItemCollapsedHover: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.06)',
    colorBgMenuItemCollapsedSelected: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.15)',
    colorBgMenuItemCollapsedElevated: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.85)',
    colorMenuItemDivider: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.15)',
    colorBgMenuItemHover: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.06)',
    colorBgMenuItemSelected: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.15)',
    colorTextMenuSelected: '#fff',
    colorTextMenuItemHover: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.75)',
    colorTextMenu: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.75)',
    colorText
```
