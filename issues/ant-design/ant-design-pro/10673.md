# 🧐[问题 | question] How to make the front end insensitive to refresh tokens based on @umijs/max

### 🧐 问题描述 | Problem description

Here's how I think about it: After a user's login, they have got two tokens (access and refresh) from the server. Before sending a request, if the access token is found to have expired, it waits to obtain a new access token from the server before continuing the current request.

May I ask who can provide reference code? Thanks!
