To resolve the "ReferenceError: process is not defined" error in React 18 with Ant Design Pro and Webpack, add the following code to your `webpack.config.js` file:

```javascript
plugins: [
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    "process.env.NODE_ENV": '"production"',
  }),
];
```

This will define the environment variable `NODE_ENV` as `"production"` and prevent the error from occurring. Note that you should remove this code when you're ready to switch back to development mode.
