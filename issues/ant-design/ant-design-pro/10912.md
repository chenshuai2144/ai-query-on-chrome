Here is a summary of the instructions to create a Dockerfile for your Ant Design Pro V5 project:

- Use the Node.js base image from Docker Hub.
- Set the working directory in the container to "/app".
- Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container.
- Install project dependencies using npm.
- Copy the rest of the project files to the container.
- Build the production version of the project using npm.
- Expose the desired port (e.g., 3000).
- Define the startup command for the container.

Customize the Dockerfile as needed, such as changing the exposed port. Then build the Docker image using the command `docker build -t ant-design-pro .`, followed by running the container with the command `docker run -p 3000:3000 ant-design-pro`. Make sure to have Docker installed and running on your machine, and that you have a working production build of your Ant Design Pro V5 project.
