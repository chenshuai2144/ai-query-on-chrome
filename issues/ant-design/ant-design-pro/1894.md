It appears that you are trying to render multiple instances of a nested table when expanding certain rows. One solution to this problem is to modify your `expandedRowRender` function to return an object that contains the original row data as well as a flag indicating whether or not the row has been expanded.
For example:

```javascript
const expandedRowRender = (record, index, indent, expanded) => {
  console.log("para=", record, index, indent, expanded);
  let rowData = { ...record };
  rowData.isExpanded = expanded;
  return rowData;
};
```

In this modified version of the function, we're creating a new object called `rowData` that includes all the original properties of the row data plus a new `isExpanded` property that indicates whether the row has been expanded. We then return this object, which will contain both the expanded and non-expanded versions of the row data.
With this modification, each instance of the nested table will only be rendered once, even if multiple rows have been expanded.
