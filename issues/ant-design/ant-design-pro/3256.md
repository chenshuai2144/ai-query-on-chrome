# Ant-design-pro two pages pass parameters, refresh page parameters become undefined?

`Ant-design-pro two` parameters pass parameters, the first click can be long jump parameters can also be passed normally, but when the page is refreshed, the parameters become `undefined`

The following is the implementation

```
<Link to={{ pathname: '/path/detail', query: text }}>{text}</Link>

componentDidMount() {
  const { dispatch, location } = this.props;
  dispatch({
    type: 'source/detailsFetch',
    payload: {
      name: location.query,
    },
  });
}
```

current version
2.1.1

The expected value is that the parameter value can be obtained after refreshing.

```
     router.push({
        pathname: '/dashboard',
        search: `product=${this.props.product}`,
      });
```

Is this method more suitable for your needs?
Refreshing the page will erase all data in memory.

I now want to use the `Link to` or `<a> tag` to implement page jumps and carry parameters, but the first time I click on the link I can get the parameters and implement the page jump. When I get to the page, I refresh the entire page. Time parameters are not available.

You need to persist the parameters. like url or localStorage
