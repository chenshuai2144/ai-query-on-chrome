This is an issue with Jest and UMI (Universal Module Importer) in a React project. The error message is "SyntaxError: Unexpected token export" which is caused by the import of `umi/router` in the component test file. The solution is to either update Node.js or use `umi/link` in the component instead of `umi/router`.
