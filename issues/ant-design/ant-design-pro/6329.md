# Error: TypeError: api.chainWebpack is not a function when using Umi with Ant Design Pro

This issue can be resolved by updating to the latest version of @umijs/preset-ant-design-pro. It is a TypeScript error that occurs on Mac OS in development environments. Pull request #146 is related to this problem, but it can be closed after updating to the latest version. The error does not depend on the specific node version being used (e.g., v14.15.5 or v16.14.2).
