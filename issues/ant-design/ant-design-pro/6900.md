# 🧐[问题] PWA doesnot work

`🕵🏻‍♀️ question`,`Inactive`

Hello,
I just enable pwa: true in default settings, but service workers is not running?

with umi v2 works well,
do you know how to fix it?
thannks

## LamdoHeaven

Actually, manifeist.json and service-worker.js are not copied or generated to output even though we set pwa:true, pwa might not have finished yet in v5.

## cundejo

PWA Is not working either in v4.2.0, and is the same issue (manifest.json and service-worker.js files missing in build).

Any idea?

## ngudeveloper

Any update about this? We used old version but we can't upgrade to new version anymore because we were using PWA......

Is it easy to move from ant design to Next.js?
