The issue is related to a SyntaxError: Unexpected token in the code. This error usually occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as a missing comma, parenthesis, or bracket. To fix this issue, you can try deleting the problematic file or folder and then rebuilding the project. If the issue persists, you may need to check the code for any syntax errors and correct them.
