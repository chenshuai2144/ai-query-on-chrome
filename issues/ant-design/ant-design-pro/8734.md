The issue is that the `commit-msg` hook is configured to run `fabric verify-commit` before committing, which is a tool for validating commit messages. The error message is indicating that the commit message does not meet the required format for automated changelog generation. The required format is specified in the `.github/commit-convention.md` file, which is a documentation file for commit message conventions. To fix the issue, you can either remove the `gitHooks` configuration or modify the `commit-msg` hook to meet the required format.
