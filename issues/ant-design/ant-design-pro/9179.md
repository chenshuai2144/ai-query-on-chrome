# Can't change the language in some places to English in Ant Design Pro

Can't change the language in some places to English in Ant Design Pro

I have tried setting up Ant Design pro locally via both yarn and npm, and everything is pretty awesome! Exept one tiny thing.. I simply cannot change the login button to English somehow. I've tried everything, from looking into the login and login wrapper code, etc. But I can't seem to find where that value is derieved from. Same goes for a lot of components inside too. The screenshot posted on the github homepage has a full English version, and I need something like that. I'm sure I'm missing a config somewhere, but can't seem to find it. Changing default locale didn't work either. I have a deadline coming up so any help soon would be really appreciated, thank you so much!

The values are hard coded in Chinese. There is a fix for this [here](https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/pull/3834). If it’s urgent, I suggest you copy the LoginForm, import the styles and change the text to whatever you wish.

I updated Ant design pro with the latest version and checked for your changes in node_modules too. They're all there, but the Login button still remains Chinese. I tried clearing my npm/yarn cache too, but it didn't help. I have no idea why this is still a persistent issue, since I saw the code and you've completely fixed it already...

If you don’t mind me asking, is your locale “en-US/UK” or another country? I ask because that text may be rendered from another Locale provider, one that can’t be overridden.

Yes that's right, I'm trying to get it to en-US, basically I want to create an english SaaS dashboard service

There is still a problem.

If we have  
(pay attention to `layout:false`)

```
    {
      path: '/user',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/user/login',
          layout: false,
          name: 'login',
          component: './user/Login',
        },
...
```

The `locale` is 'default' which is just Chinese.

If we have `layout:true`

```
    {
      path: '/user',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/user/login',
          layout: true,
          name: 'login',
          component: './user/Login',
        },
...
```

![layout_true](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44372106/138149387-2ea72f73-bdc2-4ef8-ad1c-7dbc5368b0dc.jpg)

I believe the layout has a node of `<ConfigProvider/>.` Do you have a suggestion as to how we can fix this, I will try but don't know where to start? It means that internationalisation of `pro-components` does not work unless `layout=true`.

Same issues, can anyone tell me how to fix it?

With version 5.2.0 the answer above by @adeams helped me, add the following props in the `LoginForm` component

Without **intl**

```
submitter = {
  {
    searchConfig: {
      submitText: 'Grant Authorisation'
  }
}
```

with **intl**
you may need to change the value `src/locales/en-US/pages`

```
submitter = {
  {
    searchConfig: {
      submitText: intl.formatMessage({
        id: 'pages.login.submit',
        defaultMessage: 'Grant Authorisation',
      }),
    },
  }
}
```
