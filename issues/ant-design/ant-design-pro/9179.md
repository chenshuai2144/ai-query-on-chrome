# Can't change the language in some places to English in Ant Design Pro

If you are trying to change the language of Ant Design Pro to English, but some components still display in Chinese, you may need to update the locale configuration.

## Solution 1: Update the locale configuration

You can update the locale configuration by following these steps:

1. Open the `package.json` file in your project.
2. Locate the `locale` key in the `dependencies` section.
3. Update the value of the `locale` key to `en-US`.
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the updated locale configuration.

After updating the locale configuration, you should be able to see English text in all components.

## Solution 2: Use a custom locale provider

If the above solution does not work, you can try using a custom locale provider. Here's how:

1. Create a new file called `localeProvider.js` in your project.
2. Import the `antd` and `react-intl` packages:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { FormattedMessage, defineMessages } from "react-intl";
import { useIntl } from "react-intl";

const messages = defineMessages({
  login: {
    id: "pages.login.submit",
    defaultMessage: "Grant Authorisation",
  },
});

const LocaleProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const intl = useIntl();

  return (
    <IntlProvider locale="en-US" messages={messages}>
      {children}
    </IntlProvider>
  );
};

export default LocaleProvider;
```

3. Import the `LocaleProvider` component in your `App.js` file:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { LocaleProvider } from "./localeProvider";

function App() {
  return <LocaleProvider>{/* Your application code */}</LocaleProvider>;
}

export default App;
```

4. Update the `locale` key in the `package.json` file to `en-US`:

```json
{
  "locale": "en-US",
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

5. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the updated locale configuration.

After updating the locale configuration, you should be able to see English text in all components.
