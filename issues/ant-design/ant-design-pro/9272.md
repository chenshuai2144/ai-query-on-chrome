The issue is that the current version of Node.js being used (17.0.1) does not support the digital envelope routines specified in the error message. To resolve this, you can either upgrade to a newer version of Node.js that supports these routines, or downgrade to an older version that does.
Some potential solutions include upgrading to Node.js version 18, using the `--openssl-legacy-provider` option with `npm`, or manually installing a compatible version of OpenSSL.
Note: Before making any changes, it's recommended to carefully read through any documentation or instructions provided by the developer or maintainer of the project you're working on.
