# 🧐[问题] how to modify sidebar menu

### 🧐 问题描述

I want to modify (add tooltip with description to its submenus) the sidebar menu in ant design pro but I cant seem locate the file and code. I assume the sidebar is already built-in in pro?

### 💻 示例代码

No sample code.

### 🚑 其他信息

**Edit**
ant design pro latest version
umijs latest version
windows 10 OS
node v16.14.2
React JS

**Thanks in advance!**

hello, there @chenshuai2144 , the ant design pro with umijs doesn't have a file with a sidebar component, and the routes are defined in config.js. I can't seem to understand the examples provided since both are constructed in different ways

Hi, did you found a way for that?
