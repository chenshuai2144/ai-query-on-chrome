This issue seems to be related to the use of dynamic imports in a React project. The OP is trying to dynamically load routes at runtime, but encountering issues with the Dynamic component provided by Ant Design Pro.
It appears that the problem lies in the fact that the Dynamic component requires the routes array as a parameter, which is not provided when the routes are loaded dynamically at runtime. One potential solution could be to wrap the Dynamic component inside a Route component and pass it the routes array as a prop.
Another potential solution would be to use a library such as `react-router-dom` to handle the routing logic instead of using the built-in router provided by Ant Design Pro. This way, the routes can be dynamically loaded at runtime without having to modify the existing codebase.
Overall, it seems that there are several possible solutions to this problem, depending on the specific needs of the project.
