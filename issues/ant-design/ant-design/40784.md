When using Google Chrome, the error message "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'hook')" appears when hovering over tooltips and tables. This issue can be reproduced by creating a Next.js project with version 13.x, using Ant Design's Tooltip and Table components, and then adding the following code to your page:

```jsx
import { Table } from "antd";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Table columns={columns} rowKey="id" dataSource={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

const columns = [
  {
    title: "Name",
    dataIndex: "name",
    key: "name",
  },
];

const data = [
  {
    key: "1",
    name: "John Brown",
  },
  {
    key: "2",
    name: "Jim Green",
  },
];
```

The error message should appear when hovering over any cell in the table. It is not related to any specific component or environment. The cause of the issue is still unknown, but it may be related to a conflict with another extension or plugin in Google Chrome.
