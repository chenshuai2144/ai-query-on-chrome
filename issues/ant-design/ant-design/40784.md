Sorry, I leave you the correct instruction to replicate

1. Open in new tab
2. Open Console in browser
3. Hover in button and click
4. Hover again

Incognito seems unable to replicate

## rivaslive

@afc163 This was closed not knowing if it could be replicated? The message is really annoying

## afc163

I believe it was introduced by one of your chrome extension, not antd.
