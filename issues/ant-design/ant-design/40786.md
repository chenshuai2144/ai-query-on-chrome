In the given code snippet, the height of the cards in a list varies because the content of each card is not the same in length. To ensure that the heights of all cards in the list are visually equal, one can use the `Ellipsis` component from Ant Design's Typography library. By wrapping each card with an `Ellipsis` component, the user can control the height of the cards and display "..." for any content that exceeds a certain limit. Alternatively, one can also pass in a custom prop called `rows` to set the maximum number of rows that the `Ellipsis` component should display before truncating the content. Additionally, a "Show More" link can be added to the last card to allow users to view more content when needed.
