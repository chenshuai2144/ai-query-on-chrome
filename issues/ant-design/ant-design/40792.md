The reproduction link for the broken Avatar images in the Ant Design components can be found here: <https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-xtsncw>. The issue is caused by incorrect links on several pages of the documentation, including List, Card, Segmented, List Demo Basic, List Demo Vertical, List Demo Pagination, Card Demo Meta, and Segmented Demo Custom. Expected behavior is for Avatars to display images, but they are currently not displaying due to the incorrect links. PR to fix this issue has been submitted here: <https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/40793>.
