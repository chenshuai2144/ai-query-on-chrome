@badigina-merck Hello, you can use the `getPopupContainer` property to solve this type of problem.See this link for usage https://codesandbox.io/s/condescending-water-dtcr96?file=/index.js. I hope I can help you.

Use `getPopupContainer`: https://ant.design/docs/react/faq#how-do-i-prevent-select-dropdown-datepicker-timepicker-popover-popconfirm-scrolling-with-the-page

PS: This will be auto handled in next minor version.

Thank you! I completely missed that in the docs!

Works out for my cases with AntD and AntD pro-components.
