In mobile view, the TimePicker's time selection is restricted to only allowing the user to select times after 5:30 PM. This issue occurs when calling `form.setFieldsValue` with an initial value that includes a time before this limit.
To fix this issue, you can disable the forced disabledTime when calling `setFieldsValue`. This can be done by passing a callback function as the second argument to `setFieldsValue`, and inside the callback function, you can set the disabledTime back to null.

```javascript
const handleLoadData = () => {
  const formData = { time: "8:00 AM" };
  form.setFieldsValue(formData);
};

ReactDOM.render(<App loadData={handleLoadData} />, mountNode);
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `onValuesChange` prop of `Form.Item` to update the fields values without having to call `setFieldsValue`.

```javascript
<Form.Item name="time" initialValue="8:00 AM">
  <TimePicker />
</Form.Item>
```
