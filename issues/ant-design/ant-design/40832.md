[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/suspicious-liskov-h37z9i?file=/src/App.js)

### Steps to reproduce

- Enter random time: 8:00AM
- Click "Load data"
- Try to change time again

### What is expected?

I should be able to pick any time

### What is actually happening?

I am unable to pick any time before 5:30PM when using Mobile view.

| Environment | Info   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| antd        | 5.2.1  |
| React       | 18.2   |
| System      | MacOS  |
| Browser     | Chrome |

---

This works fine in browser desktop view, but is broken on mobile view because the time is no longer scrollable

Why not? You could select time before by touchmove.

@MadCcc I don't understand what you mean or what you're asking
