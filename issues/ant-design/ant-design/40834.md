Rate component's readonly attribute has no effect on its hover behavior in dark theme. This issue can be reproduced on the official documentation page and occurs in version 5.2.2 of Ant Design. The expected behavior is that the stars should not move when the readonly attribute is set, but instead they do. This issue has been identified in the latest version of Chrome (110.0.5481.104) on Windows 11.
