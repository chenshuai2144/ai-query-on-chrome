`help wanted`,`üìù Documentation`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/steps-cn#components-steps-demo-clickable](https://ant.design/components/steps-cn#components-steps-demo-clickable)

### Steps to reproduce

The value printed after the onChange is triggered within the clickable example is current, which is an asynchronous value, which can be confusing for people reading the documentation

### What is expected?

The value printed should be the value of the callback inside the onChange

### What is actually happening?

The printout is current in the useState
