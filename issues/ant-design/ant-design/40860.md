# Date picker unexpected behaviour

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-hejwvz)

### Steps to reproduce

I use Antd and React. In my modal I set fields value with antd useForm hook. Click on datepicker and you will see weird dates with blue backgrounds.

### What is expected?

As always datepicker should render dates

### What is actually happening?

datepicker renders unknown dates and while hoverin it shows different dates such as 02.09.2120

@rustam-as Hello, I find your problem is caused by the use of `moment`. In antd v5, `Dayjs` is used instead of `moment`. You can refer to this link to [use Dayjs,](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-erw7i9?file=/index.js) or refer to this to continue [using moment](https://ant.design/docs/react/use-custom-date-library#datepicker).
