### Steps to reproduce

When using TypeScript examples field names in Form.Item are not populated with defined form type with.
I've tried providing types:
const [form] = Form.useForm<GivenType>();

And field name in Form.Item is not populated

### What is expected?

Field names should be like keyof GivenType in cases like:
<Form.Item
required
label={"Name"
name="firstName"

>

### What is actually happening?

You can enter any invalid field name

Typescript currently can not destruct with name path by given type. We extends types as possible as we can but not fully:

It's possible in react-hook-form, so your statement is not true.
