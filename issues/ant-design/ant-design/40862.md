"antd's Form component doesn't properly populate the 'name' property of a Field when using TypeScript. To reproduce, create a Form.Item with a required label and name, then use Form.useForm() with a type argument. The expected behavior is for the 'name' property to match the type argument provided, but instead it accepts any value."
