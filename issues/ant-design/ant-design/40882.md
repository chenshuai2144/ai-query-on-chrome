React 16 has an issue where the blue button closes the message after 1s, while the red button does not. This issue only appears in React 16 and is resolved in React 18. To work around this, change the hide callback order in the entire application. Ensure that the hide callback for the "message.loading" is called before any subsequent messages such as "info", "success", "error", etc.
