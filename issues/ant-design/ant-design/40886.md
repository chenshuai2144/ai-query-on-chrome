The feature solves the issue where two algorithms have different IDs, making it difficult to compare and customize them in non-antd components. The proposed API includes returning the ID of the dark algorithm (`theme.darkAlgorithm.id`) or using the constant `theme.DARK_ALGORITHM_ID`. An alternative approach is to wrap the customize algorithm with a token called `customize`.
