This feature allows passing custom options to `useMessage` and `useNotification` hooks in the `App` component. The current implementation has a bug where the `maxCount` option does not work when using `App.useApp()`. To fix this, we should pass the `maxCount` option through the `useApp` hook instead of using the static `config` method.
