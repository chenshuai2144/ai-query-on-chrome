The issue is related to the `getPopupContainer` prop in `<Select>` component. The dropdown menu gets hidden behind the cells of fixed columns when used as an editor in a fixed column in `<Table>`. The problem can be resolved by setting the `getPopupContainer` prop to `(triggerNode) => triggerNode.parentElement`. However, this may cause issues when scrolling through the table rows. The issue is being researched and a solution is being worked on.
