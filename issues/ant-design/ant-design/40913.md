I saw that same behaviour. And removing the fixed showed the menu. But it only happened if using `getPopupContainer={(triggerNode) => triggerNode.parentElement}`. Without that, it was working fine.

But after removing `getPopupContainer={(triggerNode) => triggerNode.parentElement}` when we try to scroll the table rows the dropdown of select remains on the screen while scrolling.PFA video for your reference

The dropdown of select should scroll with the respective row.

We are working on auto align which will no need additional config of `getPopupContainer`. It's in progress : )

> 我们正在研究自动对齐，这不需要额外的配置`getPopupContainer`。正在进行中:)

How's the research going
