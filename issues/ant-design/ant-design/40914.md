# TimePicker component- Adding a hour step that is not a factor of 24, or even adding a string results in unexpected behaviour

`improvement`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-bzrvwk?file=demo.tsx](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-bzrvwk?file=demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Add hourStep to TimePicker component.
Assign it a value of "1.432" as string
Assign it a value as 1.432 as number
Assign it a value of 34

### What is expected?

Expected behaviour is that only factorable values of 24 can be assigned

### What is actually happening?

It is possible to assign any value, even a string, resulting in console warnings and weird values in the component such as a number with 9 decimal spaces

I don't think developers would do something so stupidðŸ˜‚, but it could be a suggestion for improvement.

## rgumzej

Probably not, but a typo is always possible :) Could we label it as improvement then?

## Wxh16144

## rgumzej

contributor mark will be auto marked by github when PR merged. No need add additional label for this. But `assign` to developer is a good way to avoid other contributor PR for the same issue : )
