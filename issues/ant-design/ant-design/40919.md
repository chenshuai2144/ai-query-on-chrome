# [feature request] Support `sx` prop like the MUI v5 for Antd v5

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Consider the addition of the `sx` prop like the MUI v5 for the Antd v5

Through the process of using antd v5, I found everything to be great. However, there will be annoying problems when it is necessary to integrate with css frameworks like tailwindcss.

I have been using React MUI v5, and I find the `sx` prop to be a great alternative to using less, scss, tailwindcss (somewhat),... to custom style Antd components more quickly, plus it also supports styles for subclasses right in `sx` props

Suppose I use the antd's Alert Component as follows

```jsx
const AntdPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Alert message="content message" />
    </>
  );
};
```

Then HTML was born on the browser as follows

![alert-html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1908652/221370883-3a10b2f2-3aeb-4538-8ed4-8245382424d8.png)

```html
<div class="ant-alert ant-alert-info ant-alert-no-icon">
  <div class="ant-alert-content">
    <div class="ant-alert-message">content message</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And now to be able to custom style for div has class `ant-alert-contents` and `ant-alert-message`. I can do in the following way if there is `sx` prop like the React MUI v5

```jsx
const AntdPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Alert
        sx={{
          '& .ant-alert-contents': {
            background: 'yellow';
            '&:hover .ant-alert-message': {
              color: 'blue',
            }
          },
          '& .ant-alert-message': {
            color: red;
          }
        }}
        message="content message"
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

And for long -term convenience, if there is a component like `Box` of the Mui, is a wrapper for div/span ... any tag html will help us to be more flexible in the style for antd
Here is an example

```jsx
const AntdPage = () => {
  const { token } = useToken();
  const isEnable = true;

  return (
    <>
      <Box
        component="div"
        sx={{
          "& .child": {
            backgroundColor: isEnable ? token.colorPrimary : token.colorSuccess, // easy for customize with state and token
          },
        }}
      >
        This is a{" "}
        <Box component="span" class="child" sx={{ color: "blue" }}>
          component
        </Box>
      </Box>

      <Box
        component="section"
        sx={{
          marginTop: "16px",
          background: "green",
        }}
      >
        <Button type="ghost">Cancel</Button>
        <Button sx={{ marginLeft: "8px" }} type="primary">
          Confirm
        </Button>
      </Box>
    </>
  );
};
```

I think this will be a great solution for the style in the ANTD to be easier and more wonderful

Maybe you can waiting for https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/discussions/40221

I think the solution in #40221 doesn't have the flexibility to change the style like `sx` prop.

For example, if I need to style the `:hover` feature from the root class and change the style of the children element class, just adding a custom class/style for the children element is not enough.
