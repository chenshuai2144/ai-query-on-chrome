Bug reported in `antd` version 5.2.0. When the percent changes dynamically, the corresponding text displayed in the `info` section does not update accordingly. This issue can be reproduced in the code sandbox link provided. The desired behavior is for the text to reflect the updated percentage when the user clicks on a button that modifies the percent.
