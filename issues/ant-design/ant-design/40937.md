## tempoeric

but if i selected for more than 1 value there is no way to deselect the item

## zombieJ

You can combine 2 Select to handle this. When you modify `value` with `x selected items`, option of course can not be checked.

## zombieJ

One Select for your customize selection. And another with real options.
