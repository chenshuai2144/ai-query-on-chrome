Hello, I feel that the behavior of components should be consistent and should not change depending on what is passed in. ü§îü§î

@Yuiai01
Check docs:
https://ant.design/components/list#listitemmeta

`title` is ReactNode, it would make sense not to wrap it with any tag.
Since string is also possible, title can be wrapped with a default tag.

## zombieJ

Since we can not check children node real element on render. We may not support this request. You can follow the structure of title that not using additional `h5` element.

## amed

It is fully understandable that maintaining such a large project is challenging and small fixes can cause large effects. BUT:

@zombieJ we can check children on render:

https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/059042b2cdcdde663e47d3689d7ec0647fde66b1/components/avatar/avatar.tsx#L175

title prop should not be wrapped with h4 by default if it's a node. It could be the case if type is only string.
