# Tour component in Drawer

`🐛 Bug`,`👷🏻‍♂️ Someone working on it`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/modest-spence-pmsle5?file=/src/App.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Create a Drawer component. Then, add a Tour component. When the Tour component gets opened (no matter if its opened by default o by an state update) it sets a gray layer between the Tour "modal" and the app itself. The problem is that when teh Tour is part of a Drawer, the Drawer is positioned on top of the gray layer, so the UI gets very confusing.

### What is expected?

The Drawer should be behing the gray layer (mask).

### What is actually happening?

The Drawer does not appear behind the gray layer.
