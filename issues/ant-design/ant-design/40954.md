A bug exists where when a Tour component is added to a Drawer component, the Drawer appears above the gray layer created by the Tour, causing confusion for the user. This issue has been reported by `🐛 Bug`, and is currently being worked on by `👷🏻‍♂️ Someone working on it`. To reproduce the error, create a Drawer component and add a Tour component, then open the Tour and observe that the Drawer is positioned on top of the gray layer.
