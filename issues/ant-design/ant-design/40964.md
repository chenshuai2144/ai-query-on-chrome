@zombieJ I would like to pick this up.

## gitstart

@zombieJ I have so far been unable to implement this issue because the time picker dropdown values are generated by an external library called `rc-picker`, and I have so far been unable to find an effective way to format the dropdown values generated by that library. However, I am open to any suggestions as to how I can go about this differently, thanks.
