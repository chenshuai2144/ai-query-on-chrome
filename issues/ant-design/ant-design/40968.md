This issue occurs when you try to use the `suffixCls` prop on a DOM element in the `Layout` component from Ant Design v5.2.3 or earlier versions. The `suffixCls` prop is used to add additional classes to the layout container, but it is not recognized by React as a valid prop for DOM elements.
To fix this issue, you can either update to the latest version of Ant Design (v5.2.4 or later), which includes a fix for this bug, or use a work-around by using the `React.memo()` higher-order component to memoize your `Layout` component so that it only renders once and ignores updates to its props.
Here's an example of how you can use `React.memo()` to work around this issue:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useMemo } from "react";

const MemoizedLayout = React.memo(function MemoizedLayout({ children }) {
  // Your layout code here
});

export default MemoizedLayout;
```

By wrapping your `Layout` component with `React.memo()`, you ensure that it only renders once, regardless of changes to its props. This can help reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.
