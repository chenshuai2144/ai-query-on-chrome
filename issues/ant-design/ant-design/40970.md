The issue is that the `onChange` prop of the `<InputNumber>` component expects a generic type argument (`T`) which determines the data type of the value that changes when the input is updated.
However, when using a string as the value for the `<InputNumber>` component, TypeScript infers the data type of the changed value to be `string | null`, rather than just `string`.
This can lead to unexpected behavior if the developer assumes that the changed value will always have the same data type (in this case, `string`). For example, if they write code that relies on the fact that the changed value is always a `string`, they may encounter errors due to the type mismatch.
To fix this issue, the developer can explicitly specify the data type of the value that will change when the input is updated, by setting the `type` prop of the `<InputNumber>` component to `"number"` or `"string"`, depending on their use case.
Alternatively, they can configure the generic type argument of the `onChange` prop to allow either `string` or `number` values, using a union type. This will ensure that the changed value always has the correct data type, without requiring the developer to explicitly specify it.
Here's an example of how to configure the generic type argument of the `onChange` prop to accept both `string` and `number` values:

```jsx
import { InputNumber } from "antd";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <InputNumber onChange={(value) => console.log(value)} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `onChange` prop accepts any value that is assignable to both `string` and `number`. This means that it can handle values of either type, without the need for the developer to explicitly specify them.
