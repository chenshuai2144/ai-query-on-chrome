An issue with the expand icon in an Ant Design table not following the theme color has been reported. The problem can be reproduced using a ConfigProvider and changing the `token.colorPrimary` value to differentiate from the default blue. When hovering over the expand icon, it remains its default color instead of following the theme as expected. Setting both `colorPrimary` and `colorLinkHover` to the same value fixes the issue.
