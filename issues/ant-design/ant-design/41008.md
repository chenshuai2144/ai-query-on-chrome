A bug occurs in Next.js where a `Drawer` component causes mismatches during server-side rendering. The issue is caused by the use of `useLayoutEffect` in the `Drawer` component. This effect is designed to be used for effects that should happen after the element has been laid out in the DOM. However, in the case of a `Drawer` component, the effect runs after the element has been appended to the document, which can lead to unexpected results during server-side rendering.
One potential solution is to wrap the `Drawer` component in a `div` element and apply the `data-next-drawer-open` attribute to the wrapping `div`. This will ensure that the `Drawer` component is only rendered during client-side rendering, and the `data-next-drawer-open` attribute will be applied to the `div` instead of the `Drawer` component itself. Here's an example of how this could be implemented:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/core";

function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Box data-next-drawer-open={isOpen} onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>
      {/* Drawer content */}
    </Box>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Another solution is to use the `useEffect` hook to check if the `data-next-drawer-open` attribute exists and to update the state accordingly. This approach ensures that the `Drawer` component is always rendered on both client and server sides, but it requires additional code to manage the state.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Drawer } from '@chakra-ui/core';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (document.querySelector('[data-next-drawer-open]')) {
      setIsOpen(document.querySelector('[data-next-drawer-open]').dataset.nextDrawerOpen);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <Drawer isOpen={isOpen} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)} position="right">
      {/* Drawer content */}
    </Drawer>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
