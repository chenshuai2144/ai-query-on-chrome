The InputNumber component in Ant Design throws a TypeScript error when using the parser prop with values that are strings instead of numbers, even if they are successfully parsed and formatted as numbers. This error occurs when creating a form with a Form.Item containing an InputNumber and specifying the `min` and/or `max` props as strings. A possible solution is to ensure that the values passed to the `min` and `max` props are numbers, rather than strings.
