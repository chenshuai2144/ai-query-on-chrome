This feature request is for an Ant Design Checkbox Group component that can be vertically or horizontally layouted and has options for specifying the layout and display styles. The current implementation causes a margin to appear on the left side of the checkboxes beyond the first one. The suggested API includes additional props such as `layout`, `display`, and `col` for further customization.
