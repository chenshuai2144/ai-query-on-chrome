# InputNumber and Password component behaves different when importing from lib and es folders

`Invalid`,`unconfirmed`

### Discussed in https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/discussions/36814

I seen some behavioral difference when I import the component from es folder and lib folder. Please find the stackblitz demo link below.
[https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-zxppg6?file=demo.tsx](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-zxppg6?file=demo.tsx)

In this demo I imported InputNumber component from both folders and set **hasFeedback** and **validateStatus as 'validating'.** Here loading icon showing only for component imported from lib folder.

Why its happening please share details on how to resolve this?
So far we are used components from **es** folder, now i faced this issue while we are upgrading to final 4.x version.
