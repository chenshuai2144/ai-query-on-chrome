The InputNumber component behaves differently when imported from the `lib` or `es` folders, causing issues with the `hasFeedback` and `validateStatus` props. This behavior was discussed in [this discussion thread](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/discussions/36814) and can be observed in a StackBlitz demo linked in the original post. The demo shows that the component imported from the `lib` folder displays a loading icon, whereas the one imported from the `es` folder does not. This behavior is unclear and needs further investigation.
