It is not recommended to mix `lib` and `es`. This can cause a lot of problems. Because our component has a lot of context. When brought in from two different places, the two contexts will be completely different.

In the demo you provided, you can try importing the `<Form />` component from `lib` and `es` respectively to see the effect.
