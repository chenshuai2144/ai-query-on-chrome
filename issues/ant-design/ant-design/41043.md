# Why in v5 some Components the CSS has increased specificity?

`Invalid`,`unconfirmed`

Below the discussion I have at first opened.
It seems to be a breaking change in how CSS were declared for some components. And it was not mentioned in the migration guide.

Could you guys double check if this change was actually needed?

If there is no way to roll back, could you please provide a list of components so that we can programatically - and unfortunately manually, one by one - fix all of them in our codebase?

Thanks

For instance, in v4 the properties of the `.ant-layout-sider` where defined as below:

```
.ant-layout-sider {
   // ...
}
```

While in v5 the same properties are now as:

```
:where(.css-dev-only-do-not-override-diro6f).ant-layout .ant-layout-sider {
   // ...
}
```

The problem here is that the specificity of this CSS rule is increased.
I am not talking about the `:where(.css-dev-only-do-not-override-diro6f)`.
I am talking about the increased specificity coming from the addition of `.ant-layout`.

The consequence is that a simple override made with styled-components, such as the following, does not work anymore:

```
const StyledSider = styled(Sider)`
   // ... my custom rules
`
```

The reason is that styled-components adds a random class name to the Sider, like the following, which now is not winning over the antd rule anymore:

```
.eUNTQd {
     // ... my custom rules
}
```

Does anyone know why this was done and what is the quicker way to solve this issue?
I cannot go through the whole application and increase the specificity of all the overrides we have made across all the components usages.

Thanks to anyone who can help</div>
