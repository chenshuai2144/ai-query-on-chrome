This issue appears to be related to a problem with the `onValuesChange` callback function in the `Form.List` component. It seems that when elements are removed from the list using the `remove` method, the updated values are not being passed to the `onValuesChange` function as expected.
One potential solution to this issue would be to update the `onValuesChange` function to handle the removal of elements correctly. This could involve checking for the existence of the removed element in the input values before updating the fields array, and skipping over any updates if the element is no longer present.
Another possible solution would be to modify the `onValuesChange` function to accept an additional argument, which would allow it to be called with a specific set of input values. This could make it easier to track changes to individual fields within the list, rather than having to rely on the entire list of fields being passed to the function as a single object.
Overall, the best approach to resolving this issue will depend on the specifics of the application and its requirements. It may be necessary to consult with the maintainers of the `rc-field-form` library or seek out additional resources to determine the most effective solution.
