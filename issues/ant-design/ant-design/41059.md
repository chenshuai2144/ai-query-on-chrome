I don't know why sandbox reset my changes. Just change DatePicker to TimePicker. Also you can check it in docs page.

I tried to reproduce the question, but I seem to be able to scroll without clicking, and you can watch this video I recorded.

It looks like a desktop. But my issue on Android. Sorry, maybe I confused you by saying "click" instead of "tap".

Ok, if you want to run it on mobile, I recommend using it [Ant Design Mobile](https://mobile.ant.design).

But my app used on different platforms, and it's not good idea to support two different layouts just because unexpected behaviour of one component.

## Yipee-ki-yay

I've fixed that issue just in the css by enabling the scroll on the devices with the mobile size:

```
.ant-time-picker-panel .ant-time-picker-panel-select {
    overflow-y: auto;

    @media (min-width: 1024px) {
      overflow: hidden;
    }
  }
```
