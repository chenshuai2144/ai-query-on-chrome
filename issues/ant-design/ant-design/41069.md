Antd Pagination component should allow customization of display options such as showing "10 items per page" or "20 items per page". It should also allow configuration of the position of the showSizeChanger. The current implementation displays "10 items/page" and "/page" should be removed. Additionally, the display can be modified by customizing multilingual text. The position of the showSizeChanger cannot currently be moved to the left, but it can be customized on the left side with an online example available at <https://codesandbox.io/s/more-antd-undefined-forked-jiftlr?file=/MyPagination.tsx>.
