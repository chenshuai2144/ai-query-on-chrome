### What is expected?

The Summary cell containing the Switch component should be fixed to the right side.

### What is actually happening?

The Summary cell containing the Switch component has wrong spacing in rtl direction.

The problem is from `rc-table` package. I think I've found the problem, https://github.com/react-component/table/pull/964
