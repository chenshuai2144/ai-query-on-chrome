# Input.Group size=large or size=small is not honored for the button

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-w13m6t?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Create a compact `Input.Group` size set to 'large' or 'small' with one input and one button in it.

### What is expected?

It is expected that the `size` modifier on input group will be honored by buttons inside it.

### What is actually happening?

The sizes 'large' and 'small' are not applied to the button in `Input.Group`. If the size is set to 'large' manually on button, the border radiuses will be incorrect, and input and button will look separate.

let me have a look

@armpogart Hello, the size configured on input. Group only applies to the internal input. You can take a look at this.https://ant.design/components/input#inputgroup

## kiner-tang

@armpogart why not use `Input.Search`? Like this: https://ant.design/components/input-cn#components-input-demo-search-input

## armpogart

@kiner-tang Cause it's not a search actually, and I have custom icon in instead of text in the button. As far as I see I can't set custom icon for `Search` input and also control when the button (only button not the input) is disabled or not.

## armpogart

@Yuiai01 I see, but it's not stated in the examples section explicitly, where the example with button is shown. Also why not to apply it to internal buttons, or at least honor the border radiueses when the button in input.group has explicitly set the size?

why not? you can pass custom ReactNode into `enterButton`, see this:

## armpogart

@kiner-tang So you mean I can pass `<Button icon={...} />` directly there? That will solve the problem, but it will be still not intuitive to use `Search` for getting something completely not search related, so I'm not sure why not to support the sizing for internal buttons.

why not just pass a icon? like this:

  ## armpogart

  @kiner-tang How do I enable/disable the button in that case? I need a way to control whether the button is enabled.

  ## zombieJ

  We should update doc here. Since Space.Campact is the replacement of Input.Group:
