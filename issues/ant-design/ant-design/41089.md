`unconfirmed`

### Steps to reproduce

```
yarn && yarn start
```

### What is expected?

These two buttons at the top should have their default color right? But it's not rendering it's default color. Although the border is rendering fine.

### What is actually happening?

It's rendering transparent I guess. But on hover it's rendering the default sky blue color.

### Additional info

It was first intercepted after I entroduced _manual code splitting_, here:

Check your code, it seems override by other style which not belong to antd.

Dear @zombieJ,

Turns out there were no css importing issues in my code. But as I intruduced `rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` in my code recently, it was splitting the `.css` file along with all the `.js` files. So it was creating some issue, I'm still not sure (other than tree-shaking), what issue was that.

But I resolved it simply by excluding all the `.css` file from splitting.

Maybe it will help someone:

But, it still leaves us with one problem, and that is bulky css. I guess, we can study more, and fix it.

Good day.üç∑
