`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-usage-antd-undefined-forked-zs4dfm?file=/demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Change input data and blur input or change to another field

### What is expected?

The rule should be executed when the actual input loses its focus

### What is actually happening?

It's only validating when submiting the form

Should be nice to add types to validateTrigger instead of only type `string | string[]`
It should have all available trigger options

`validateTrigger` in `rules` must be the sub set of `validateTrigger` in Form.Item.

Yes yes, I got that...
But validating `onBlur` is not working. `onChange` (default) and `onSubmit` are working fine.

It should be nice if you set the `validateTrigger` type to something like `onSubmit | onChange | onWhateverAnyOtherOption...` instead of just leaving it as `string | string[]`.
Every component has defined types, e.g.: Buttons... if I want to change button type for example, when I write `type='....'` VSCide intelisense shows all available type options `primary | ghost | dashed.....`
But `validateTrigger` type is only `string | string[]` this doesn't helps because we have to guess what we can type in there and, if we misstype anything, TS will not throw any error... This could lead to a hard to find error.

Hope you take all of this information in consideration to reopen this issue because I always read all the documentation and spend a lot of time testing every possibility before opening issues

I agree with @nonam4, it would be easier to type validateTrigger with `onChange | onSubmit | onBlur` etcâ€¦ for a better understanding of the code and to avoid making mistakes such as typos.
