The issue occurs when the value of `key` in `rc-tabs` does not comply with the syntax used by `document.querySelector`. The error message appears when trying to render the component and indicates that the query selector syntax is incorrect. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to avoid using double quotes as part of the `key` value.
