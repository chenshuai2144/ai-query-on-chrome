Summary:
Passing an empty array as the `columns` prop in the custom `body` component of the Ant Design table results in a warning message. To resolve the warning, add a `width` property to each column in the `columns` prop. This can be reproduced using a codesandbox link (https://codesandbox.io/s/dou8ne) with React version 18, MacOS, and Chrome latest.
