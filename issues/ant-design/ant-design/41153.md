Ant Design's Tooltip component does not work properly with SVG elements as children, and there is someone working on it.
Steps to reproduce:

- Use an SVG element as children
- Hover over the SVG element

Expected: The tooltip should appear
Actual: The tooltip uses the wrong left and top position (-1000vh)
Environment:

- Ant Design version: 5.3.0
- React version: 18.2.0
- System information: MacOS 12.6.3
- Browser: Google Chrome 110.0.5481.177 (x86_64)
