# [feat] Please unify APi style

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

there are three types of Api when u try to style the Modal, `width` / `bodyStyle` / `wrapperClassName`, which are not uniform and make it so bad.

### What does the proposed API look like?

make them unified, style/property/className. do not mixed them in a single Api
