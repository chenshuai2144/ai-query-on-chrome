This feature aims to unify the styling options for Modal components, currently available as separate properties (`width`, `bodyStyle`, `wrapperClassName`). The proposed API would combine these into a single `style/property/className` format, avoiding confusion and making the code more consistent. A related RFC is also being discussed.
