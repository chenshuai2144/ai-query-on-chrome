# Confirm Modal has an empty div below confirm buttons

`üêõ Bug`,`üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Someone working on it`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-zjshu0?file=/index.js:940-950)

### Steps to reproduce

Click on a 'Confirm Modal' button and look at the confirm buttons position. I added Default Modal for a comparison.

### What is expected?

Styles of the modal are the same when opening with `confirm` function or `<Modal>` component.

### What is actually happening?

When opening a Modal with `confirm` function, confirm buttons are too distant from the bottom edge of the Modal.
There's an empty `div` element (ant-modal-footer) that has a 12px top-margin that is causing misalignment.
