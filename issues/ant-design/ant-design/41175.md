@Yuiai01 The issue is with any button with multiple segments (eg. drop down button).

Are you asserting that you don't believe there is any issue in my screenshot?

## Yuiai01

@mellis481 I'm sorry. I may have misunderstood. But the page I saw looked like this.

@Yuiai01 It looks like you're looking at 4.x. Current master branch (5.x) looks like this: https://ant.design/components/dropdown#components-dropdown-demo-dropdown-button

No, I checked the link you provided, and I also checked the official example of 5.x, but the problem you mentioned did not reappear. ü§î

@Yuiai01 You're not tab-focusing the button (like a keyboard user would do). You're just clicking the button with your mouse.

Yes, the focus style of the button is masked. I'll try to fix it.
