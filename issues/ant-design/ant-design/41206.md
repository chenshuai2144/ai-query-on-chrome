The problem is caused by the fact that `React.memo` is used in `Ant Design` components, such as `Table`, which makes it difficult to track the changes between instances. This causes the error message when the value of `forceAlign` or `forcePopupAlign` properties in the `ProTable` component does not match the expected type.
To solve this problem, one solution is to use a function to calculate these properties instead of a constant value. For example:

```javascript
const calculateForceAlign = (props) => {
  // Calculate the forceAlign properties...
};

const calculateForcePopupAlign = (props) => {
  // Calculate the forcePopupAlign properties...
};
```

Then pass these functions as props to the `forceAlign` and `forcePopupAlign` props in the `ProTable` component, like this:

```javascript
<ProTable
  forceAlign={calculateForceAlign}
  forcePopupAlign={calculateForcePopupAlign}
  ...
/>
```

This way, the values of `forceAlign` and `forcePopupAlign` will always be calculated based on the current props, making it possible to track their changes.
