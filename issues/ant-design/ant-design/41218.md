# Progress Bug/Question

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Full width gradient color/inset for progress. At the moment it shrinks the color, so a multi gradient setup is compressed.

Also, overflow hidden for status 'active' is not working on Safari. Clear edge of container

### What does the proposed API look like?

Inset of BG color and progress bar reveals it.
