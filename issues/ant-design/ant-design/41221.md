# support to set fields' warningOnly message

`📝 Documentation`

### What problem does this feature solve?

for now, the warningOnly message ONLY could be set in rules. But now I would like to have a warning tip which won't block the submit by call `form.setFields`

### What does the proposed API look like?

```js
form.setFields([
     { name: 'myName', warning: [new Error('It's warning')] }
])
```
