The feature request is to allow buttons to have filtering capability similar to tables in Ant Design. The proposed API would include a button with the type of 'filterButton'. After selecting data using the filter button, the data should be displayed as expected.
As of now, there are no plans to implement this feature in Ant Design. However, users are encouraged to implement it themselves if they need it.
If you need assistance implementing this feature, you may reach out to the community or the maintainers of Ant Design for help.
It is recommended to approach this issue through implementation in your own application rather than requesting funding from Ant Design.
