# Form.Item Label requiredMark position

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

In some design requiredmark of the required field is placed at the right of label, but currently we only have it on the left side of label.

### What does the proposed API look like?

`<Form  requiredMarkPosition={'right'}/> `default behavior would be same as it is right now. person should be able to chnage required mark position at Form level or at least at the Item level

In doing so, the API becomes too fragmented. You can HOC Form.Item to realize it:
