To reproduce: open CodeSandbox demo on mobile or responsive view, click header "Click me in responsive view", see tooltip "Hello, world!", click X on tooltip, it closes but `onOpenChange` fires with value `true`. Second time clicking X it closes correctly but no `onOpenChange` fired. Expected: On mobile, clicking X sets open prop to false and `onOpenChange` fires with value false, but second time clicking X doesn't trigger an `onOpenChange`.
