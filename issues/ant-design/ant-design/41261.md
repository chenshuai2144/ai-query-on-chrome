# Maximum update depth exceeded on Select components

`üêõ Bug`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/select](https://ant.design/components/select)

### Steps to reproduce

Open https://ant.design/components/select and try multiple time focus and remove focus from Select component quickly. I made a screen recording of it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4uhgjhjr5spq7hv/screen-capture.webm

We started to catch this issue with our e2e runner Cypress first.

### What is expected?

Select works as usual

### What is actually happening?

Select crashes with `Maximum update depth exceeded` message

My guess this started to happen after https://github.com/react-component/resize-observer/pull/172 PR
