@afc163 @MadCcc please check

Select don't contain native select element in it, so I don't think type of Select ref should be a HTMLSelectElement.

## tempoeric

so what ref should i use atleast give me a selectprops as ref or something

## tempoeric

cause im having issue without ref in select

```
Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?
```
