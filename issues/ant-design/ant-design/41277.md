The `onClear` property of the `Select` component in Ant Design does not work correctly when used in conjunction with a form. When a user selects an option from the dropdown and clicks the reset icon, the selected value is always reset to `undefined`. The expected behavior is that the value should be cleared using the `onClear` property, regardless of whether it was previously set using `setFieldsValue`. To fix this issue, the `normalize` function should be used in combination with `onClear`.
