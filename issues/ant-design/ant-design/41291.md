# Config Provider API does not allow customization for button text.

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-btn-color-forked-fd6319?file=/src/App.tsx:327-926)

### Steps to reproduce

Customizing text for AntD button through Config Provider doesn't work. Above is the link to codesandbox that displays a button component.

### What is expected?

I expect the button text to change change on hover but it doesn't.

### What is actually happening?

I have played around all the text variables but nothing seems to be working. Ideally applying colorPrimaryTextHover should change the color of the button text but it doesn't.

| Environment | Info                |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| antd        | 5.3.1               |
| React       | "react": "^18.2.0", |
| System      | mac m1              |
| Browser     | chrome              |

@zombieJ how would you change the button text color on hover? Don't see any token for that?

but this is not working on your colorPrimaryTextHover: "green"
