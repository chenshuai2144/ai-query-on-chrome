I need RangePicker to show only one picker when picker= 'mouth'

I read that other solutions are hiding through CSS, and I wonder if there are other solutions?

I found a solution, but I don't know why

```jsx
<RangePicker picker="month" showTime format="YYYY/MM/DD" />
```

Hiding through CSS is what we recommend, there is no plan to add a option about it.
