The issue is related to the `Antd RangePicker` component, which shows multiple pickers when the `picker` prop is set to `'month'`. The proposed solution is to use the `showTime` prop with the `format` prop set to `'YYYY/MM/DD'`, which will display only one picker. Another recommended solution is to hide the additional picker using CSS.
