# `NumberInput` warning about `useLayoutEffect`-usage when using NextJS

`improvement`

### Reproduction link

[https://github.com/AntonPieper/inputnumber-warning](https://github.com/AntonPieper/inputnumber-warning)

### Steps to reproduce

Use a [`InputNumber`](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/input-number/index.tsx)-component anywhere inside a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) page. When running the NextJS server via `npm run dev` the warning will be shown.

An example of a page that shows the warning:

```tsx
import { InputNumber } from "antd";

export default function Home() {
  return <InputNumber />;
}
```

### What is expected?

No warning should be shown.

### What is actually happening?

A warning shows up in the console:

> Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server, because its effect cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format. This will lead to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this, useLayoutEffect should only be used in components that render exclusively on the client. See [https://reactjs.org/link/uselayouteffect-ssr](https://reactjs.org/link/uselayouteffect-ssr) for common fixes.

## MadCcc

It is intended that we use `useLayoutEffect` for client rendering, and it works fine in SSR.
This warning actually didn't mean anything wrong in InputNumber.

## AntonPieper

But this does result in noise in the logs which could be prevented by i.e. not running the code on the server (`if (typeof window === "undefined") { ... }`)
