Next.js warns about using `useLayoutEffect` in an InputNumber component when running the development server with `npm run dev`. This warning occurs because `useLayoutEffect` has no effect during server-side rendering, leading to a mismatch between the initial UI and the intended UI. To resolve this issue, the recommendation is to avoid using `useLayoutEffect` in components that render exclusively on the client.
