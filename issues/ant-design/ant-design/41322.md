### Steps to reproduce

- Open drawer

- Nothing is happening, the submit button is not hooked up to the form because the mark up is disconnected.

This essentially makes forms unusable inside drawers.

Hi @NavaceSystem, Since your submit button is outside the form form, you can use the form instance if you want to submit outside the form. I changed your example a little. https://codesandbox.io/s/submit-form-in-drawer-antd-5-3-1-forked-4p6p7k?file=/demo.tsx
