When testing a Table Summary Cell component using Jest, a TypeError occurs stating "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prefixCls')".

To reproduce, create a dummy component containing `<Table.Summary.Cell>` and run tests. The expected outcome is successful rendering of the component, but instead, an error message is displayed.

The issue has been reported on the official Ant Design repository, where it was stated that the problem cannot be reproduced and the provided link is unable to be accessed.
