`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/typography#typographytext](https://ant.design/components/typography#typographytext)

### Steps to reproduce

The Typography component has 3 elements: Title, Text Paragraph.

### What is expected?

Responsive text depending on screen resolution

### What is actually happening?

Now text rendered by Typography is not responsive

| Environment | Info         |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| antd        | 5.3.0        |
| React       | 18.2.0       |
| System      | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Browser     | Chrome 111   |

---

How can I make the text they render shrink/enlarge according to the current screen resolution?

You can try https://github.com/malte-wessel/react-textfit

@afc163 this package has 30 open issues and the last commit was 3 years ago so using it as project dependencies can cause problems

## evgeniyworkbel

I use react 18 and I have just installed react-textfit, but it doesn't work - text is still unresponsive. Please reopen this topic

@afc163 could you reopen this topic?

It's really painful to redefine Ant's styles, and here's why:

1. ConfigProvider does not allow setting fontSize: 'inherit'.
2. The elements body, a, and others have predefined font sizes.
3. It is necessary to use !important to override inherited styles.
4. 14px is clearly not a standard size, 16px is the minimum in this century.
