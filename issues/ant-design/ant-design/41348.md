Native components cannot implement complex interactive function, so we implement the Select component by customizing the dom structure.

When I used the screen reader software JAWS, I didn't want to press the up or down key to open the drop-down option directly. I wanted to press the "enter" key to open it

## CanXinWu

Attempts to prevent the up/down keys from acting by default were also prevented by 'preventDefault'
