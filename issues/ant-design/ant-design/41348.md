Ant Design's Select component cannot implement complex interactive functions like the native select tag. It is implemented by customizing the DOM structure. The component does not support accessibility and may have issues with using the "Enter" key to open the drop-down options when using screen readers like JAWS. Attempting to prevent the up/down keys from functioning by default has been unsuccessful.
