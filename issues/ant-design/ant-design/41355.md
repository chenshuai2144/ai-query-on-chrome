The error is occurring because the `onChange` prop passed to `RangePicker` expects a callback function that takes two arguments, `value` (which should be either a `Dayjs` object or `null`) and `dateString` (which should be a string). However, when passing the callback function defined in `handleDateChange`, it only has one argument `dateString`. To resolve this issue, you can modify the signature of `handleDateChange` to accept both `value` and `dateString` arguments, like so:

```typescript
const handleDateChange: DatePickerProps["onChange"] = (
  date: Dayjs | null,
  dateString: string,
): void => {
  console.log(date, dateString);
};
```

Alternatively, you can pass a modified version of `handleDateChange` to `RangePicker` that accepts both `value` and `dateString` arguments:

```php-template
const handleDateChange = (date: Dayjs | null, dateString: string) => {
  console.log(date, dateString);
};

// ...

<RangePicker.RangePicker
  onChange={(date, dateString) => handleDateChange(date, dateString)}
  size="small"
/>
```

This way, `RangePicker` will receive the correct signature for the `onChange` prop, and the error should be resolved.
