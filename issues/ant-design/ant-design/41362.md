@hbatalhaStch If you don't want to display popover when mouseover modal, you can move the Modal outside the content of popover.

As @kiner-tang said. It's not a bug.

Popover trigger visible event in `hover` when `target` or `popup` trigger `mouseEnter` event. In React, virtual dom tree is not same as native dom, Modal is still the `children` of `popup`. If you do not need this, you can move Modal out instead.

Thanks for for clarifying this for me. It makes sense now and I was able to fix my code.
