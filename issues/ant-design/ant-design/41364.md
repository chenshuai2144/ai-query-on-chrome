The error message suggests that the `items` property does not exist in the `BreadcrumbProps` interface defined by Ant Design. To fix this issue, you can add the `items` property to the `BreadcrumbProps` interface like so:

```typescript
interface BreadcrumbProps {
  items: BreadcrumbItem[];
}
```

Then you can use the `items` property in your code without getting an error. Alternatively, you can use `infer` as suggested by @keita-determined to dynamically determine the type of the `items` property at runtime. However, this approach may not be ideal and could lead to potential issues if the shape or behavior of the `items` property changes in future versions of Ant Design.
