TreeSelect/Select's `maxTagCount` set as "responsive" may cause unexpected behavior when dealing with large amounts of data. When selecting an item and unselecting it quickly, the label of the selected item will temporarily show up as two lines due to the overflow caused by the Select component stretching to accommodate the long label. This issue can be resolved by optimizing the usage of `rc-overflow`.
