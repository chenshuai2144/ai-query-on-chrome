The "useStatus" hook in Ant Design's Form component appears to have an issue where it does not correctly update the status in some cases. This results in unexpected behavior, such as an incorrect initial state for the status, and the incorrect order of states when changing the input value. The issue affects both the start of input and the transition from invalid to valid.
