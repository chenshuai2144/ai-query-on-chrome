An issue with setting `overflow调整X轴和Y轴` on `<select>` to `false` in Ant Design version 5 has been reported. The behavior of the dropdown of the `<Select>` component varies, sometimes opening at the bottom left and sometimes at an unexpected location. A reproduction link is provided, along with steps to reproduce the issue. The expected behavior is for the dropdown to open below the `<Select>` component, similar to how it did in version 4. The current behavior of having the dropdown occasionally open at an unexpected location is not desired. The environment includes Ant Design version 5.3.2, React version 18, macOS Ventura 13.2.1, and Google Chrome 111.0.5563.110.
