# Set overflow on select to false does not work

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-u8nr7k?file=/index.js&resolutionWidth=685&resolutionHeight=476)

### Steps to reproduce

To be honest I don't know what the issue is the only thing I know is that I can't deactivate the autoOverflow from the dropdown of the select component eventhough I set the dropdownAlign to:

```tsx
<Select ... dropdownAlign={{ overflow: { adjustX: false, adjustY: false } }} >
  ...
</Select>
```

like suggested here: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/12070#issuecomment-558683920

### What is expected?

Version 4.x worked for us. So I would love to have the same behaviour of the select box as before.

### What is actually happening?

The dropdown of the Select component is sometimes opened bottemleft and sometimes where it wants. So I would love to set the autoAdjustOverflow to false like I can on the Tooltip component.
