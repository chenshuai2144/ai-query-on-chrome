# An input element is not bound when using `genComponentStyleHook`

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-j6v3vp?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

If you are already opened the sandbox link, just click the **Check** button.

### What is expected?

I expected to see the input element change its status when the form was invalid.

### What is actually happening?

It realizes the invalidity of the form by showing the `message` value provided in `rules`, but it does not make the input's borders red.

| Environment | Info      |
| ----------- | --------- |
| antd        | 5.3.2     |
| React       | 18.2.0    |
| System      | Ubuntu OS |
| Browser     | Firefox   |

---

I also tried to achieve this by providing the input reference to the `useStyleRegister` hook, returned by `genComponentStyleHook`, thinking that it would bind the input and handle the needed changes, but it did not work.

## MadCcc

Well, that's really not recommended to apply style to components in this way, and your usage of `genComponentHook` is totally wrong. If you are interested in how antd apply styles to components, just check the [source code](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/input/Input.tsx).

Going to close this issue because of unexpected usage.
