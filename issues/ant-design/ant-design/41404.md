A bug occurs where removing and adding elements from a shadow DOM causes a dropdown to stop functioning correctly. This issue is observed in environments using Ant Design version 5.3.2 with React 18.0.0, running on Windows with Chrome or Edge as the browser. It can be reproduced by hovering over the dropdown and seeing the console logs, then clicking "Remove everything" to remove the element with a shadow DOM from the DOM, followed by "Add everything" to add the element back. As a result, the dropdown's state becomes inverted, with some of its items having `pointer-events: none;` when they should be clickable, and the dropdown showing up even though it should not. The issue has been fixed with the latest version of `@ant-design/cssinjs`, specifically `@ant-design/cssinjs@1.6.2`.
