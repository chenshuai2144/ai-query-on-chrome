# Allows Filtering the Ok and Reset Button in the Filter Dropdown of nzTable

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Some times, we do not need a reset button, and we need to disable it, or hide it so that we don't confuse the user and there isn't any way to do this customization other than using ng-deep which leeks to other components. using :host with ng-deep doesn't affect the style of the button

### What does the proposed API look like?

[nzResettButton]=hide
or (onReset)="onResetBtn($event)" so that we can override default behaviour of reset button
