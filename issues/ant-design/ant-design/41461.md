Ant Design now offers the ability to add both big and small calendar dropdown options to the `DatePicker` component using `<Select>`. This feature helps developers customize the user experience, display additional information, and ensure consistency and compatibility within the Ant Design library.
The `Calendar` component is provided in a dropdown that can be customized to fit different use cases and design requirements. Additionally, the `Select` component allows developers to control the appearance of the dropdown, including its size, match select width, and position.
The API for the feature includes a `DropdownRender` prop that allows developers to customize the appearance of the dropdown, including the `CalendarData` function that returns an array of calendar options to be displayed in the dropdown.
Overall, this feature provides greater flexibility and customization options for developers working with the `DatePicker` component in Ant Design.
