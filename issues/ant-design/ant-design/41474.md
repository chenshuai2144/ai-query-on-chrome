The collapse component currently only supports `onChange`, which returns an array of active keys as parameters. This makes it difficult to get the expand status and active key after they have changed. To overcome this limitation, the feature request is to add support for `onExpand` which takes in two parameters: `activeKey` and `expanded`. If `expanded` is true, the component should request the details for the active key using the `requestDetail` function.
