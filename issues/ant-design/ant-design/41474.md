# Collapse component should support onExpand

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

For now, the Colllapse ONLY support onChange which would get all activeKeys as params. We can't convenient to get the expand status and changed activeKey just changed.

Think of the following:

1. We need Collapse to show something, but the details are load-on-demand.
2. So we are supposed to get the activeKey and the expand status to request the detail.

### What does the proposed API look like?

```tsx
export default () => {
  <Collapse
    onExpand={(activeKey, expanded) => {
      if (expanded) {
        requestDetail({ id: activeKey });
      }
    }}
  ></Collapse>;
};
```

Maybe it could be handled with the `onItemClick` event? I'm sorry that this is not specified in the documentation. See the [test case](https://github.com/react-component/collapse/blob/aac303a8b6ff30e35060b4f8fecde6f4556fcbe2/tests/index.spec.tsx#L656-L681) here for details. but you can't tell the current expanded state by the function arguments.

`onChange` is enough in your case:

```tsx
export default () => {
  const [activeKey, setActiveKey] = useState([]);

  return (
    <Collapse
      onChange={(keys) => {
        if(keys.include('xxx') && !activeKeys.includes('xxx')){
          requestDetail({id: xxx})
        }
        setActiveKey(keys);
      }}
   />
}
```

And your request is more like `afterChange`.
