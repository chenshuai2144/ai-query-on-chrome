antd doesn't seem to be compatible with Next.js' hydration process, causing an error when using it in combination with the Modal component. The issue has been reported and discussed in multiple GitHub issues. To resolve the issue, one option is to use forceRender prop on the Modal component. Another solution is to follow the official documentation on customizing the theme for server-side rendering in Ant Design.
