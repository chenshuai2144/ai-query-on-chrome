A bug that when setting fixed header in table and dropdown is shown under the fixed column, the overlay follows the scrolling of the table horizontally. A reproduction link can be found at https://codesandbox.io/s/gu-ding-biao-tou-ant-design-demo-forked-zvuift?file=/index.js. The expected behavior is that the dropdown should not follow the scrolling of the table. The actual behavior is that the dropdown does follow the scrolling of the table. This occurs with Ant Design versions 4.19.4 and higher. A possible solution involves using recursion to find the nearest tr element to the dropdown container and then attaching it to the tr element. However, this may cause issues with tr width.
