# CheckBox text on the left

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Hello,
In the last version available, when using the CheckBox, the text is on the right and the selection is on the left.
I want the opposite of that. That is, the text is on the left and the selection box is on the right.
How can I do that?

### What does the proposed API look like?

[CheckBox](https://ant.design/components/checkbox)

Or you can use checkbox only without text and wrap by your own to adjust.

Or css to change the order of inline-flex layout
