The warning "findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode" appears when using the `<Dropdown>` component from Ant Design in a strict mode environment. This warning is caused by the fact that `findDOMNode` is being used to access the underlying DOM node of the dropdown component, which is not allowed in strict mode due to its potential security risks.
To resolve this warning, one option is to upgrade to a version of Ant Design that uses a different method for accessing the underlying DOM node, such as `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`. However, this may require changes to your codebase and could potentially introduce other issues.
Another option is to wrap the `<Dropdown>` component in a custom component that implements the `useRef` hook, and then pass the returned ref to the `<Dropdown>` component. This allows you to access the underlying DOM node through the ref without triggering the deprecation warning.
For example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from "react";

const CustomDropdown = ({ children }) => {
  const dropdownRef = useRef(null);

  return <div ref={dropdownRef}>{children}</div>;
};

// Then use the custom dropdown component instead of the regular one
<CustomDropdown>{/* Dropdown content */}</CustomDropdown>;
```

Note that using a custom component like this may require additional effort to maintain and update your codebase, so it should only be considered as a last resort if other options are not feasible.
