This issue seems to be reporting a problem with the Ant Design library causing flashing when used in combination with server-side rendering (SSR). The Ant Design team has provided a solution for this problem, which involves using their `create-next-app-antd` template and updating it to the latest version. If you encounter further issues, you can try creating a new project from the latest version of the template to see if the problem persists.
