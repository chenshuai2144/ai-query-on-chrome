@getvega Hello, `hasFeedback` needs to be used with `validateStatus`, like this: https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-usage-antd-5-3-3-forked-hc8fim?file=/demo.tsx

## getvega

Thanks for your help 🙏 .

From the docs:

> `validateStatus` The validation status. If not provided, it will be generated by validation rule. options: success warning error validating

So it means that validation status is optional and computed from the validation rules execution right? Regardless of `hasFeedback` property?

I got the same problem.
The errors can set manual from API response. There for it should be changed as @getvega said.

## Yuiai01

Ok, so the logic can really be optimized here, so let me try it. @getvega @duypham90

I found that the state I got was wrong when setting the icon corresponding to feedback, which is a bug. I will fix it.
