The `hasFeedback` prop in Ant Design's Form component only shows a success icon instead of an error icon when `validateStatus` is set to something other than "error", even though an error message is displayed below the form. To fix this, use the `validateStatus` prop with a value of "success", "warning", or "error" to set the feedback icon accordingly.
