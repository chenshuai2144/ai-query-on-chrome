An issue with `RangePicker` occurs when the `value` is `[null, null]` and the `disabled` is `[false, true]`. The error message is "Maximum update depth exceeded". To fix this issue, please check if your `value` is using the correct format for dayjs array, and if the `disabled` is using the correct type as moment or null. This issue was fixed in rc-picker version 3.5.0, but it has not been backported to previous versions. If you are still encountering the issue, you may consider upgrading to rc-picker version 3.5.0 or higher.
