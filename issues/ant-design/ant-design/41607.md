# Prevent ConfigProvider from importing large, unnecessary packages | é˜²æ­¢ConfigProvideråŠ è½½æ²¡ç”¨å¹¶ä¸”è¿‡å¤§çš„package

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`

### What problem does this feature solve?

ConfigProvider by default includes `rc-field-form` as a dependency, and includes it even when there are no forms in your app. This is a large package that causes a significant increase in bundle size.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Only include that dependency when your app uses Ant Form and it's being configured by the ConfigProvider

## Trayja

Maybe we could have a way of easily using `DesignTokenContext.Provider` without using `ConfigProvider`

## zombieJ

FormProvider not contain fully `rc-field-form` content by its `import`. Could you help to provide reproduce about this?
