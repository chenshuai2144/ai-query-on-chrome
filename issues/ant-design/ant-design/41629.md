The problem occurs when rendering a select component inside a popover based on a state value, and adding a remove button to remove the rendered select. The error message thrown is "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'contains')" from node_modules. The issue is specific to Ant Design v5.x and seems to have been fixed in version 1.6.3 of @rc-component/trigger. However, there is another issue where the popover closes when the remove button is clicked, and a fix is needed to prevent this behavior.
