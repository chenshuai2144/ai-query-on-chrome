# error with provided config file code (upgrade to v5)

`Invalid`,`unconfirmed`

          Im following the upgrade guide of antd5 and have a problem with the point on [less migration](https://ant.design/docs/react/migration-v5#less-migration). I copied this to webpack config, then installted atn-design https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/20833. Now im getting following error:

Maybe you can provide a more detailed documentation and/or how a valid configuration should look like. From the error message I understand that its not a valid code with "options" property.
