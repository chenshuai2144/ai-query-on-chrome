### Steps to reproduce

Do you search form elements with the "enter" key? When I check the checkbox or after selecting the selectbox, I want to search with the enter key on the keyboard, but when I press the enter key, the selectbox opens again and I cannot search. Can you give me a hint on how to do this?
