# Type definition of modal buttons doesn't allow `data-*` attributes

`help wanted`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-typescript-forked-c9bbi8?file=/demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Try to pass any `data-*` attribute to the cancel or the submit buttons of the modal. This will result in a TS error as it's not allowed. Adding `@ts-ignore` comment will show that will actually work

### What is expected?

No TS error

### What is actually happening?

Error stating that

```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and '"data-testid"' does not exist in type
```

According to the above issue, writing attributes with horizontal bars in tsx will not do type checking, so in fact `data-*` and `aria-*` have never appeared in the type definition at all, but tsc skipped type checking , this phenomenon is also true in components, and it is not unique to native DOM elements, which means that attributes with horizontal bars cannot be transparently transmitted through object, and must be written directly in the jsx tag.

They produce an error because in the modal props they are passed as object properties, not JSX attributes
