The TypeScript error occurs when trying to pass data-_ attributes to modal button components. The expected behavior is for there to be no errors, while the actual behavior is that an error message appears indicating that the data-testid property does not exist in the specified type. This is due to TypeScript skipping type checking for attributes with horizontal bars, such as data-_ and aria-_ attributes. To resolve the error, the data-_ attributes can be passed directly in the JSX tag instead of as object properties.
