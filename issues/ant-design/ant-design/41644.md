DatePicker.RangePicker in Drawer has inconsistent alignment, overflow, and bad user experience. It should be fixed to have its position within the full viewport and minimize scrolling/overflow if possible. Currently, the issue causes the date picker to overflow with scrollbars, which makes it difficult for users to select dates. This problem also exists in different viewports and leads to irrelevant console warnings.
