Bug report: Ribbon text line breaks do not work correctly in Ant Design 5.4.0.
Steps to reproduce:

- Write "Line 1" in the text attribute of Badge.Ribbon
- Add `<br/>` to create a line break
- Write "Line 2"

Expected result: The Ribbon should cover both lines "Line 1" and "Line 2".
Actual result: The Ribbon covers only "Line 1". The issue appears to be with the fixed height setting at `287px`.
Environment:

- Ant Design version: 5.4.0
- React version: 18.2.0
- System: Windows 10
- Browser: Microsoft Edge
  Possible solution: Consider adding responsive design to the Ribbon so that it adjusts its height to accommodate multiple lines of text.
