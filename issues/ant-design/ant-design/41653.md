`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-badge-ribbon-kqbkfs?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

- In text attribute of Badge.Ribbon
- I wrote Line 1
- I wrote <br/> to line break
- I wrote Line 2

### What is expected?

The Ribbon must cover Line 1 and Line 2

### What is actually happening?

The Ribbon cover only the Line 1

| Environment | Info           |

| React       | 18.2.0         |
| System      | Windows 10     |
| Browser     | Microsoft Edge |

I guess the design is not responsive to line breaks ?
