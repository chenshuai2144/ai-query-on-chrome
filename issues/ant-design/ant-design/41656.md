`Form.Item` with `valuePropName` cannot have its value dependent on the state. Repro steps: Create state with initial value as true, create Form element and place a Form.Item with `valuePropName` set to `checked`. Place an inner Form.Item with a Checkbox component and set its `checked` prop to `{state}`. Add a send button. Expected result: The Checkbox value should depend on the state. Actual result: The Checkbox has no value and becomes undefined when the send button is pressed.
