# valuePropName of Form.Item does not allow child's value to depend on the state

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/jolly-smoke-mpm2wu?file=/src/App.js)

### Steps to reproduce

- create Form element
- place Form.Item with `valuePropName` = checked
- place inside Form.Item Checkbox with `checked` = { state }
- place send button

### What is expected?

checkbox's value depends on the state

### What is actually happening?

checkbox is undefined

| Environment | Info               |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| antd        | 5.3.3              |
| React       | 18.2.0             |
| System      | Windows 11         |
| Browser     | Opera 97.0.4719.43 |

---

In repro I added a button that changes state but checkbox still does not change its value. Removing valuePropName allows checkbox to depend on the state but when send button is pressed checkbox is undefined (because valuePropName is not defined)
