Strange, I can not reproduce this. Could you help to test other browser?

You need to create enough Modal

## rick-chou

I've found in my testing that this problem occurs when the browser is full screen and there are enough modals, but not when the browser is not full screen, so I'm just curious as to where the problem occurs

Thx for tips. Tested with other browser seems it's Chrome only. It may be bug with Chrome which need more dig.

Tested. When disabled mask it will still blink:

But again hide svg path, blink gone:

Seems it does be the bug of Chrome. Pls feel free to fire issue to https://bugs.chromium.org/ instead.
