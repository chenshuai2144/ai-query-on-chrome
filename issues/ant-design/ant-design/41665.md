To use Ant Design components with TypeScript and avoid errors related to importing ES modules with `require`, you need to configure TypeScript to treat your codebase as an ECMAScript module. You can do this by adding the following configuration to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```css
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext"
  }
}
```

Then, update your `package.json` file to include the `tsc` command in the `"scripts"` section to compile your TypeScript files before running `npm run docs`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "docs": "tsc && npm run serve Docs"
  },
  ...
}
```

Finally, update your `scripts` section in your `tsconfig.json` file to include the `serve` command:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "docs": "tsc && serve Docs"
  },
  ...
}
```

Now when you run `npm run docs`, TypeScript should compile your code correctly and generate documentation using `typedoc`. If you still encounter any errors, make sure that all of your Ant Design imports are properly formatted using `import { ... } from '@ant-design/...';` rather than `require('@ant-design/...');`.
