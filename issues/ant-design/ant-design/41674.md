# [Form] How to validate unmounted Form.Items?

`🤔 Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

When `Form`'s `preserve` prop is true, unmounted `Form.Item`s' field values are preserved. Then, how can i validate field values including those unmounted but preserved field values?
When i called form.validateFields and form.getFieldsError, both methods didn't validate unmounted field values.

When unmounted. Your Field is gone which means no bind `rules` on the field. What you need is `hidden`:
