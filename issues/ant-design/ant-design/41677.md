## yoyo837

Remove `node_modules` and lock file (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` .etc), then reinstall it.

## yoyo837

And need `antd@5.4.2+`.

@Yuiai01 Can we fix it for 4.x?

We are working on 4.x for more than 2 years. Now i don't think we can directly move our project to 5.x+ .

## saurabhsain20

@yoyo837 @Yuiai01 Is it going to be fixed for v4.x?
