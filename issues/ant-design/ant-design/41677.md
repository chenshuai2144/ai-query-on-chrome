The issue of being able to navigate to and select past disabled dates in the Ant Design Calendar has been resolved in the latest 4.x release. The problem was caused by the addition of a condition for disabling past dates in the Calendar component, which allowed users to select them using keyboard navigation. A fix has been implemented that prevents users from navigating to and selecting past disabled dates, improving accessibility and usability for users with disabilities.
