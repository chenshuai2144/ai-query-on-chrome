Request for feature: Allow disabling Form.Item error messages during validation. Problem solved by using `validateStatus`, but requires extra code complexity. Proposal is to use an empty `message` prop in `Rule` object to apply `ant-input-status-error` class. Online demo not available without more specifics.
