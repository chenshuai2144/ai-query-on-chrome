"Hook usage recommended" reproduction link: <https://codesandbox.io/s/hooks-usage-recommended-antd-5-4-0-forked-zeuxnz?file=/demo.tsx>
Steps to reproduce:

- Try to pass `bottom` argument to `api.info` similar to the `top` argument.
  Expected behavior: `api.info` accepts `bottom` argument similar to the `top` argument.
  Actual behavior: `api.info` does not accept `bottom` argument similar to the `top` argument.
  Environment information:

- antd version: 5.4.0
- React version: 17.0.2
- System information: Mac OS X 12.6
- Browser information: Chrome

The issue is that the `bottom` argument is not supported for the `api.info` hook in Ant Design v5.4.0.
