```
Argument of type '{ message: string; description: JSX.Element; placement: NotificationPlacement; top: number; bottom: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ArgsProps'.
  Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'top' does not exist in type 'ArgsProps'.ts(2345)

Maybe there is a problem with the documentation, you can use style first.

```
const openNotification = (placement: NotificationPlacement) => {
    api.info({
      message: `Notification ${placement}`,
      description:
        'This is the content of the notification. This is the content of the notification. This is the content of the notification.',
      placement,
      style: { bottom: 240 },
    });
  };
```

Seems your reproduce not throw TS error.
