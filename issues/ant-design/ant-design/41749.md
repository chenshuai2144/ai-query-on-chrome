A fix for a styling issue in the `DatePicker` component of Ant Design was released in version 5.4.1 of Ant Design, which includes a fix for NextJS compatibility issues with the use of es modules. The fix involves changing the import statement for the `DatePicker` component from `"antd/lib"` to `"antd/es"`, which allows for proper styling in a NextJS project.
