`requiredMark` is always config on Form level since v4 instead but pass the TS support in Form.Item by mistake:

Add could you tell which case you need is on the Form.Item instead of Form level?

I've changed the usage of requriedMark to form level in my code, frankly speaking it was used in only a few places. I've no idea why it was coded that way, my point is that I upgraded to the latest version of the package and got this issue. My expectations were that upgrading a minor version would not result in a breaking change, and even if it did, it would be documented in the docs.

Thanks for feedback. But I still need to check the real world usage case that `requiredMark` must be on Form.Item instead of Form.

Since the docs are clearly stating that it won't work in Form.Item and not write the API of Form.Item about this, it's bug as feature instead of remove feature by version.

As talked above, I want to check whether we need do this as official support.

## HermanBilous

I checked our usage of requiredMark, and it appears that switching from using it from Form.Item to Form in 5.4.0 does not make any visible differences, so it's safe for us to change usage.

As for the docs, I agree, they clearly state that it's not something that we should use. Still, I'm mostly working with code, and if I have a prop that works and exists in the interface, I will use it. Even if it's not in the docs.

Thanks for feedback. Please feel free to comment if meet any case current Form `requiredMark` can not satisfy : )
