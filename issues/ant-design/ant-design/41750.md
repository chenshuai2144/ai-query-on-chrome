The issue is that the `requiredMark` prop has been removed from the `Form.Item` component in version 5.4.1, and using it will cause a build error. The change was made in a previous release, but the release notes did not mark it as a breaking change. To fix the issue, users should update their code to use the `form.requiredMark` property instead of `Form.Item.requiredMark`.
