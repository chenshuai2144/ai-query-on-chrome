The Input.Password component in Microsoft Edge displays an additional "view password" icon when typing, which is unexpected and unconfirmed behavior. This issue has been observed in versions 5.3.2 of Ant Design and higher, as well as in recent versions of React and various operating systems including Windows.
To reproduce the issue, open the provided code sandbox link using Microsoft Edge and start typing in the input field. You will see two icons displayed on the left side of the input field, with the first icon being the standard "Eye" icon for viewing the password in plain text, and the second icon being the "View Password" icon that appears when typing.
To resolve this issue, one possible solution suggested by @stefanjudis is to hide the additional "view password" icon using CSS styles.
