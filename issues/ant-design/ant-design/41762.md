When setting the `spinning` prop of the `<Spin>` component to `undefined`, it should not spin, but currently it does. This behavior is unexpected because `undefined` is typically considered a falsy value in JavaScript/TypeScript, which means that it should not trigger any spinning behavior. To fix this issue, it may be better to use a default value for the `spinning` prop, such as `false`, so that the component does not spin by default when `spinning` is not explicitly set.
