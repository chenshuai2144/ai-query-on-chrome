### Steps to reproduce

Set the prop 'spinning' of the component `<Spin>` to undefined.

### What is expected?

when the component `<Spin>` has its prop spinning set to undefined, it shouldn't spin.

### What is actually happening?

When component `<Spin>` has spinning set to undefined, it spins.

| Environment | Info               |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| antd        | 4.24.7             |
| React       | 17.0.2             |
| System      | windows and linux  |
| Browser     | Firefox and Chrome |

Being 'undefined' a falsy value in general for javascript/typescript, it makes more sense to make `<Spin>` not spin when spinning is set to undefined.

But if `spinning` is not set, the value is also undefined. Because `spinning` defaults to true, undefined is converted to true.

```jsx
<Spin spinning={undefined}></Spin>
```

is equivalent to

```jsx
<Spin></Spin>
```
