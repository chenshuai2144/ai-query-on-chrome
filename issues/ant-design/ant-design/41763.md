# Why is the Layout Header black?

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/layout](https://ant.design/components/layout)

### Steps to reproduce

The default Layout Header color is black. Why? the menu is white, the header on the ant.design website is white, but for me it is black for some reason?

I tried to change the color manually, but then the dark theme messes up because it doesn't change to black again.

### What is expected?

White header

### What is actually happening?

Black header

If you check the code, you will find it's not default `black`:

```tsx
<Menu
   theme="dark" // ðŸ‘€ Default is light, prop set to `dark` here
   ...
>
```

But why is it made in such a confusing way? When the theme is light, the header needs to be light. Is there a way to fix it?

Setting header to light manually in CSS will make it act weird if I activate darkMode theme for the entire site.
