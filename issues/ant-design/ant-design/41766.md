It should be easy to customize css not only in this component, both for beginners and advanced developers

Try `dropdownStyle`.

@afc163 I think you misunderstood what I meant not the height of the wrapper but the height of the list, here the data is only visible until 'willy' should appear full to the bottom above the button.
and if the data is more than that it will scroll automatically
the class **.rc-virtual-list-holder** doesnt work to set height

## afc163

We may need a `optionRender`. @ant-design/ant-design-collaborators @ant-design/ant-design-core
