The problem is that the `getValueFromEvent` prop is not being passed correctly to the `ExemptAttachmentsUpload` component, which means that the `normFile` function inside of it is not able to access the file list. To fix this, you can pass the `valuePropName` prop to the `Form.Item` as `fileList`, like so:

```javascript
<Form.Item label="比价/豁免附件" valuePropName="fileList">
  <Form.Item name="exempt_files" getValueFromEvent={normFile} noStyle>
    <ExemptAttachmentsUpload getExemptUpload={getExemptUpload} />
  </Form.Item>
</Form.Item>
```

This will ensure that the `normFile` function has access to the file list, and should allow it to retrieve the file list correctly.
