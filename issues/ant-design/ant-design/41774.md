# Tree Checking is very slow and causes a large re-render when you have a lot of nodes expanded

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-y0zxtg?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Load ~1000 items into tree data and expand all the items, check the root level node

### What is expected?

The tree should be able to efficiently manage checking nodes when they have many expanded child items

### What is actually happening?

The tree takes 2-4 seconds to render the checkbox ticks and locks up the system

| Environment | Info                  |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| antd        | 5.4.2                 |
| React       | 18.2.0                |
| System      | Windows               |
| Browser     | Chrome 111.0.5563.147 |

Virtualization doesn't appear to have fixed the delay when checking the root node of a large tree.
