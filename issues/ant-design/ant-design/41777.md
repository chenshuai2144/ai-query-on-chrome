`animation` is effectStyle which is no need in SSR, so the extract function will not generate this for saving bundle size.
Your reproduce problem is that generated css file not using hash but runtime use. You should align them to ensure hydrate working:

It looks like NextJS causes some problems (or i did something wrong again)
