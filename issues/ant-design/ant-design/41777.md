Dropdown menu behaves inversely when CSS hashes are disabled. The issue can be reproduced by generating a CSS file without hashes, enabling it, adding a dropdown menu, hovering over the menu, and then hovering away from it. The expected behavior is for the menu to open when hovered over and close when hovered away. However, the actual behavior is for the menu to open when hovered away and close when hovered over. This is because the generated CSS file does not use hashes, while the runtime uses them. To resolve the issue, you should align the generated CSS file and the runtime to ensure hydration works correctly.
