# Allow disabled submit button until ready, by adding .validateFields(false)

`ðŸ’¡ Feature Request`,`Inactive`

### What problem does this feature solve?

A common form design pattern is to disable the submit button until the form is ready.

Previous issues around this do not address this issue:

- https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/4374
- https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/21439
- https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/15674
- https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/23887

Requirements:

- You don't simply want to trigger validation on all fields, causing errors to be shown before the user starts changing anything.
- You don't want to require the user touch every field, since some fields are optional, or maybe the form is pre-filled.

A solution: let the user run validations on all form fields at initialization time, without updating the form state (like would happen with .validateFields()). The user can then maintain/update this state themselves as the fields change.

(Alternatively, Form internally manages this secondary field state.)

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
await Form.validateFields(false)
```

Do not update the internal error states, only return the states.

Do you mean not showing errors and only disable Submit Button if there's error in form?

@MadCcc That's right, you don't want to immediately display errors before the user has even started interacting. So you don't want to simply call .validateFields().

At the same time, you **do** need to immediately run the validations **somehow**, in order to determine whether the submit button should be enabled or disabled (at the start). For instance, maybe you have an empty form, and some of the fields are required, in which case the button should be disabled. Or, maybe the form is prefilled, and all the data is already valid, so it should be enabled.

also hope this feature, that's reasonable!
