# When showCount and extra are used in TextArea, they are overlapped

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/nest-antd-5-4-2-forked-133y0g)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add the form with a text area
2. Set up long "extra" and function for showCound

### What is expected?

The showCount element should be shown as it was shown in the previous versions, in a separate block. Instead, it's rendered wrong with overlapping the extra text.

### What is actually happening?

Not sure, but it looks like the developers moved the extra from "after" to some other element and it just doesn't work correctly when "extra" is used too.

| Environment | Info                  |

| React       | 18                    |
| System      | Windows 7             |
| Browser     | Chrome 109.0.5414.120 |

Note. First, I found this issue in 5.0.1.

Anyway, Ant.design is really great framework!

I'm sorry I probably forgot to add the code. Please see the updated code now, it looks like this:

You don't plan to fix the bug? Why? And may some human look into it and decide if it's planned or not? Many thanks.
