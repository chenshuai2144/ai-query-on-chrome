Modal body's padding cannot be cancelled with `bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}`. It has been moved to `ant-modal-content` in v5, so customizing it using `padding` may not work. Try using `margin` instead. If you prefer v4 behavior, consider wrapping your app with a `ConfigProvider` that sets `components.Modal.wireframe = true`.
