# Can't cancel modal body's padding

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/ji-ben-antd-5-4-2-forked-2cks0c?file=/demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

set bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}

### What is expected?

I used to customize padding this way in the past, but it doesn't seem to work recently.
And I don't want to override antd's css style through global css

### What is actually happening?

/

| Environment | Info   |

| antd        | 5.4.2  |
| React       | 18.2.0 |
| System      | macos  |
| Browser     | chrome |

## MadCcc

Modal style is updated in v5, and padding of `body` will not be the same as before.
Now the padding is on `ant-modal-content` element, which makes Modal whole.

Try to customize in this way with `margin`:

If you prefer Modal of v4, please try to use ConfigProvider to wrap your application.

```
<ConfigProvider
  theme={{
    components: {
      Modal: {
        wireframe: true,
      }
    }
  }}
>
  {children}
</ConfigProvider>
```
