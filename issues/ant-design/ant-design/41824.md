Using Ant Design in Next.js causes a useContext error on load. The reproduction link is <https://github.com/VanshSh/next-valid-date>. The expected behavior is for the checkbox to appear on page load, but it does not. The actual result is an error. The environment includes Ant Design version 5.4.2, React version 18.2.0, a Windows system and Chrome browser. This issue has been resolved.
