A reproduction of the issue can be found at <https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-lhz5it?file=/index.js> and video of the failure in Safari: <https://www.loom.com/share/b7aac25d8f80416dad6889ad4f9a1d75?from_recorder=1&focus_title=1>. The issue occurs when a modal with a collapse inside it is opened in WebKit/Safari and the collapse is expanded. The modal appears jittery and has strange visual artifacts.
