There is no `hashed` config in ConfigProvider accroding to officail documentation: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme

## Skyriis

Yeah it looks like it is missing on the documentation but exists for sure. I already run into an other issue in #41777 where is forgot to disable `hashed` at static style extract and at runtime.

## MadCcc

`hashed` is re commended to be `true` since it may cause theme mixed up when turned to `false`.
That why it was not included in the document.

## MadCcc

Seems animation didn't generated correctly.

Do not import from `antd/lib`. Your ConfigProvider from `antd` path and Dropdown from `antd/lib` path which is not the same in NextJS. Import from same one instead:

```diff
-- import { ConfigProvider, Space } from "antd";
-- import { Dropdown } from "antd/lib";
++ import { ConfigProvider, Space, Dropdown } from "antd";
```
