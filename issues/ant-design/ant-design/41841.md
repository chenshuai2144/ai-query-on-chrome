Next.js app's dropdown menu misbehaves when the `hashed` option in CSS generation script & root layout config provider is disabled. To replicate, follow these steps: install Ant Design & Static Style Extract Script, disable `hashed` option, add dropdown menu, hover over menu & away from it. Expected: menu opens on hover & closes on hover away. Actual: menu opens on hover away & closes on hover over.
