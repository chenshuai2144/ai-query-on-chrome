In order to migrate component less variables in v4 to Component Token in v5, it is necessary to follow certain steps:

1. Identify all the Less variables in v4 that are intended to be used in v5.
2. Convert these Less variables into Component Tokens.
3. Initialize these Component Tokens with related Design Token in genComponentStyleHook.
4. Ensure that all usage of tokens in style is updated accordingly.

A list of Less variables that need to be converted into Component Tokens is provided in the issue summary. This includes variables such as `@modal-header-padding-vertical`, `@modal-header-padding-horizontal`, `@modal-body-padding`, `@modal-header-border-width`, etc.
It is recommended that developers who plan to migrate their codebase to v5 start doing this process immediately, as the migration process may take several months. Additionally, it is important to carefully test the migrated codebase to ensure that it works correctly and meets the desired design standards.
