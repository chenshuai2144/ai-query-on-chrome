Bug in `App.useApp()` theme style customizability. Info icon doesn't dynamically change color, causing inconsistent button behavior when token changes. Reproduction link: <https://onlyling.github.io/antd-cssinjs/#/antd>, steps: click "TEST MESSAGE WIDTH APP", then "token1", then "TEST MESSAGE WIDTH APP", finally "token reset". Expected behavior: info icon should dynamically change color with token changes, buttons should behave consistently. Current code available at <https://github.com/onlyling/antd-cssinjs/tree/main/src/modules/antd/index.tsx>.
