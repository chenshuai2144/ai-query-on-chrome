In version 5.4.2 of Ant Design using React 18.2.0 on an open source system with an open source browser, there is a bug where setting a Select's `value` prop to `null` while it is within a `Form.Item` component will cause the Select not to clear its value. This only occurs when the Select is within a `Form.Item` component. If the Select is not in a `Form.Item` component, it can be cleared normally. To work around this issue, remove the `name` property from the `Form.Item` if you do not want to control the Select's `value` through the Form store.
