# Cannot clear Select Component's value if it is within a Form.Item Component

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/clear-antd-select-0190s9?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Just click the "Clear Select" button, the select cannot be cleared

### What is expected?

The select should be cleared.

### What is actually happening?

It appears that if set a `Select`'s `value` prop to `null`, the Select did not clear its value, this only happens when the Select is in a `Form.Item` Component, if a `Select` is not in that component, the `Select` can be cleared normally.

When you set `name` on Form.Item, all the `value` is control by Form store:

If do not want to control by form, remove `name` instead.
