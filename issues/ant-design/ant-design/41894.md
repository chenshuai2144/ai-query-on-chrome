# Theming is buggy

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-syrxss?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Check comments in the repro, comment/uncomment lines of theme config to see the result.

### What is expected?

Proper configuration.
Ability to not specify not required properties (basically, any of them) and use default values.

### What is actually happening?

Bugs. No default values applied. Mess with units, aka `px`, some variables requires it, some not, inconsistently (fontSize vs fontSizeLG) depending on usage (obviously will fail in response design).
fontSize requires `px` specified despite the number format.
Some properties are required. If not specified - result in bunch of NaNs braking the layout.

Didn't find anything wrong when change `font-family` to `14`. Could you provide a case that is broken?

> result in bunch of NaNs braking the layout

Currently in our type definition, `font-size` `line-height` and `padding` and some other tokens are all `number`, because we need them to do some calculation for dynamic theming. You can simply set them all with number.

Hm, I guess this might be related to pro-layout (which I recently dropped in favor of manual layout). Looks like everything is fine now, so nvm.
