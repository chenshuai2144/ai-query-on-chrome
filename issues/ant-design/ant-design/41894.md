The reproduction link is provided. Steps to reproduce include commenting/uncommenting lines of theme configuration. Expected behavior includes proper configuration and the ability to use default values. Actual behavior includes bugs such as inconsistent application of units, required properties that must be specified, and NaNs breaking layout. This appears to be related to pro-layout and has been resolved.
