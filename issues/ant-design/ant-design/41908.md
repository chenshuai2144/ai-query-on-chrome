Ant Design's Date Range Picker often appears too wide on mobile devices, making it difficult or impossible to use. To address this, there are several proposed API changes:

- When the screen width is less than a certain threshold or the width of the picker is greater than or equal to the screen width, switch to a one-calendar view instead of two.
- If time selection is enabled, initially hide the time picker and allow users to select a day. Once a day is selected, show the time picker as an additional view within the selection window.
- Provide the option to display a list of preselected options, which can be accessed through a button in the header or footer of the picker view.
- Optionally, switch the picker view from floating mode to modal mode at a certain screen size.
- Ant Design recommends using `antd-mobile` for mobile device-specific components.

Users may not expect a pop-up when choosing a time on a mobile device, and there may be further improvements to the UX of the Date Range Picker.
