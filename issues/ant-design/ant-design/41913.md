There's strange behavior in the DatePicker component when used inside a form with a default value set to "unconfirmed". The calendar doesn't show up in the correct month or year, all days are marked as selected, and hovering over them changes the date automatically. This issue occurs in versions 5.3.0 of Ant Design and requires either using Dayjs instead of Moment, or following the instructions for continuing to use Moment. To reproduce the issue, open the DatePicker in the reproduction link provided.
