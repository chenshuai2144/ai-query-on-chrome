The ability to disable "css-dev-only-do-not-override" classes has been added to Ant Design's ConfigProvider component. This allows users to remove these annoying classes that appear during V5 updates. The proposed API is `cssDevOnlyClassesEnabled: boolean`. To use it, import `ConfigProvider` and set `theme.hashed` to `false`.
