ConfigProvider > theme > hashed

## marcoangelo

Thanks. For anyone else wanting to know how to implement this in React as an example:

```
import { ConfigProvider } from 'antd';

  <ConfigProvider theme={{ hashed: false }}>
    <App />
  </ConfigProvider>
```

> ConfigProvider > theme > hashed

I would like to rename this hash value. Are there any open areas for modification
