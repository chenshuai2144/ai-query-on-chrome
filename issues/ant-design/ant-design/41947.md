5.4.0 修改了边框样式所在的元素，原本是在 textarea 上的，看起来需要兼容一下。目前版本可以这样：

Let me have a look ~~

I need to pass this on to others who are familiar with the repo.
So I did my best to look into both the [AntDesign](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) and [rc-textarea](https://github.com/react-component/textarea) repos, and I found that the inline style in the `<span>` element is not updating like the `<textarea>` element does. I tried to find the logic that controls the resizing value and put it into the <span> element, but I could not find it (maybe it's handled by [rc-resize-observer](https://github.com/react-component/resize-observer)). So, I am passing this along to someone who may be familiar with the above repo. Cheers!
