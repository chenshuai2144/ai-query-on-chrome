Antd Table with custom header and scroll prop has an incorrect border-radius on the columns header. The issue arises only when both the header and scroll props are defined. Reproducible example: <https://codesandbox.io/s/border-title-and-footer-antd-5-4-5-forked-q2cf7p?file=/demo.tsx> Expected behavior: Custom header should not affect column header border-radius. Actual behavior: Column header has a border-radius even with custom header, only present when scroll prop defined. Environmental factors: Issue reported in antd version 5.4.5.
