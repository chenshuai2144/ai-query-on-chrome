When using modals in tables, unexpected results can occur if the same item in the data array is not available to both the modal and the button when clicking on the delete action. It seems that the correct item is selected in the button but the wrong item in the modal. The issue may be caused by opening all modals at once, resulting in multiple modals being displayed with the last one in the front. To fix this issue, you need to adjust the logic of your application.
