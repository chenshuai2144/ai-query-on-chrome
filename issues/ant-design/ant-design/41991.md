Pass prefix to filterOptions callback in <Mentions> component to filter options by prefix. Currently filterOptions does not receive the selected prefix as parameter making it impossible to filter options by prefix within that function. Proposed solution is to add prefix as a third parameter to the callback, this allows for handling the filtering logic without causing unnecessary component rerenders.
