# Please allow us to not show the checkbox for some menu options in Cascader (in multiple mode)

`ðŸ’¡ Feature Request`

### What problem does this feature solve?

When in multiple node, the Cascader shows a checkbox for every single option. Can you please allow us to not show the checkbox for some options, similar to the ReactSuite Multicascader uncheckable parameter: https://rsuitejs.com/components/multi-cascader/#uncheckable

Sometimes we need to allow the user to make multiple choices for say depth level 2 but not for level 1.
For example, I want to show the users the option to pick A _or_ B on the first level, but allow the user to pick as many of A's children as needed.

### What does the proposed API look like?

<Cascader uncheckable={[option1 option2 option4]}>

I used https://github.com/react-component/cascader/pull/408 and https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/42024 to complete this featureðŸ˜„

There should be nothing wrong with the feature. You can check the feature by clone both projects and use the npm linkâœ…

But strangely enough I managed to complete the unit test on https://github.com/react-component/cascader/pull/408
But the https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/42024 test failed. He told me invalid hook call, it's may be react verision confilct because of npm link

I have not mentioned pr to `rc-component` before, I don't know if it's because of local debugging, but please help me look at it. @zombieJ @li-jia-nan @MadCcc

So grateful, thank you @BoyYangzai ! I'll try it asap - not sure how to patch the local antd version but will try to figure it out. You are an angel!
