In controlled mode, when a user enters a character that matches the pattern set by `normalize`, the cursor automatically moves to the end of the text input field. This behavior is different from what users expect, as they typically expect the cursor to stay in the same place after replacing a character with another one. A possible solution would be to add an additional prop to the Form.Item component that allows users to specify where they want the cursor to be after the normalization operation takes place. Another option would be to provide a separate event callback that users can use to manually update the cursor position after the normalization operation completes.
