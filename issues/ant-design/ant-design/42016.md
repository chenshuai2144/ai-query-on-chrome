This is a commonly observed practice in web design. It is frequently employed when working with scrollable content, whereby the scroll bar disappears after a period of inactivity and reappears when scrolling resumes. As an illustration, please try using the scroll feature on the left sidebar of the website youtube.com.

I agree that the youtube example is nice, where the content is static and the scroll appears on hover and is not hidden until cursor is moved away. But for the AutoComplete search component it turns out to be quite confusing. It disappears quickly and users are complaining that the data is not loaded while it's just the hidden scroll issue.

It is intented to simulate as MacOS scrollbar behavior.
