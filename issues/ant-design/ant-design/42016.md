AutoComplete drop-down scroll disappears after some time of inactivity, but reappears on scroll. This behavior simulates MacOS scrollbar behavior. To replicate, click on the input to see the drop-down options with the scroll visible, wait a few seconds, then observe the scroll disappear. The issue can be resolved by reloading the page or pressing escape to hide the dropdown.
