TabPane in antd is deprecated, please use items directly in the Tabs component. If you have multiple components to render within each tab, you can map through the product array and access the individual product contents through the . operator, and then render them in a list within each tab. Make sure to import necessary modules and follow the recommended structure for the tabs component.
