The issue is that the Upload button inside a disabled Form component remains disabled even when explicitly setting the "disabled" prop of the individual Upload button to false. The cause is that the Button component within the UploadList is using its own context's disabled state rather than the parent Form component's disabled state. This can be resolved by wrapping the entire UploadList component in a DisabledContextProvider and passing down the disabled prop from the parent Form component to all children within the UploadList.
