For another components (ex. Modal buttons has text). That logic expected for onFilter column. Maybe missing onFilter column locale in merge ConfigProvider locale options.

you should use the `locale` as AntD demo
https://ant.design/components/config-provider-cn#components-config-provider-demo-locale
`import enUS from 'antd/locale/en_US';` or
`import zhCN from 'antd/locale/zh_CN';`
and
`locale = { enUS/ zhCN }`
if you do as demo , the text will be correct show
the reason why you can't show it's text is that there is not correct `locale` Object from `locale` props
