Ant Design DatePicker component doesn't support Azerbaijani language out of the box. To fix this, you need to import the dayjs locale file for Azerbaijan (az_AZ.js) and use it in your configuration. This can be done by adding the following line of code:

```javascript
import locale from "antd/es/date-picker/locale/az_AZ";
```

Then pass this locale to the `locale` prop of the DatePicker component:

```javascript
<DatePicker locale={locale} />
```

This should ensure that the Calendar displays dates in Azerbaijani language.
