I looked up the source code and found that the language file needed for dayjs is missing here
But the last time I saw the code change was three years ago, and it seems to be an old problem.

I added `require` to dynamically fetch the required language file and it works just like it should

But I'd better consult with the official people first

@FatimeyiZahra @piperchester @richard-schiemenz
Currently it can be possible to guarantee proper usage by importing the corresponding dayjs language files
