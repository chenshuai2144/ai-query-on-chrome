# Allow developers to control which Cascader tags (in multiple mode) have the "clear" button and which don't

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

When using the Cascader in multiple mode each tag that gets created (each selected option) can be cleared using the little x button. I would like to be able to enable/disable the x button on each tag individually.

I need it in order to not allow the user to clear some options until certain conditions are satisfied.

I love the work you do (thank you so much), this is a lower priority item for me but I would use it as soon as you implement it!

### What does the proposed API look like?

Probably a "clearable" boolean parameter that defaults to true on every single Option.

For the record,. I managed to achieve this by using diplayRender to draw custom tags

Could you provide a codesandbox for those who have same requirement?

## georgeciobanu

Apologies @afc163, I was wrong: in "multiple" mode a custom displayRender function renders each selectedOption within a closable Tag, and that cannot be changed.

Here's an example https://codesandbox.io/s/custom-display-render-cascader-0ilkst?file=/demo.js

I would love to be able to have full control over what is rendered for each option in multiple mode as well. In other words, when a custom displayRender is provided as a parameter in "multiple" mode, I would prefer to have nothing (or a simple div) as the render parent for each selected option instead of a closable tag. This would actually be consistent with what happens in non-multiple mode, where we can render anything we want. Is it reasonable to say that this is a "bug" or at least an inconsistency in how "displayRender" works in single vs multiple mode?

To be clear, I understand the convenience of using closable Tag elements as the parent element (I'm sure it makes sense for a lot of users as the default behavior) and appreciate your work and attention detail in doing so.

In summary, I believe you should _not_ use a Tag as the render parent in multiple mode when a custom displayRender is provided by the user because:

1. The user provided a displayRender function which means they intend to draw custom UI for each option the user selected
2. It is inconsistent with the behavior of displayRender in single selection mode (where the component just displays whatever the function returns)
3. The current functionality is easily achieved by trivial displayRender code that can be provided as example to the user:
   `return (<Tag closable> {labels[ labels.length - 1 ]} </Tag>`

I'll create a new issue for this.
