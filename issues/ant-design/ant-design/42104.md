### Steps to reproduce

### What is expected?

we expect the popup should stay open

### What is actually happening?

the popup closed

| Environment | Info      |
| ----------- | --------- |
| antd        | 5.4.6     |
| React       | 18.2 & 17 |
| System      | mac m2    |
| Browser     | chrome    |

---

this behavior only happens when clicking on the icon , if we click on any other place the popup will stay open

quick fix for me was to wrap the content with a div and prevent bubbling but its seems like a bug and not something that I should add manually

```typescript
      <Popover
        content={
          <div onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
            <Tree
              showLine
              showIcon
              defaultExpandedKeys={["0-0-0"]}
              treeData={treeData}
            />
          </div>
        }
        placement="buttom"
        trigger="click"
      >
        <h1>click to open popup</h1>
      </Popover>
```
