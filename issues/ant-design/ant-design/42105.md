This feature solves the issue of needing to right-click on a table row to access actions that are not easily accessible from the left-hand side. The proposed solution is to include a "render" function in the "row" prop of the table component, which would allow for the addition of an "Dropdown" component with the "trigger" prop set to "contextMenu".
