# Can open dropdown menu when right click on table row

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

for the ux, traditional way we need to put action button on the left in table row but some time user need to right click and open or use some function in action button without drag mouse to the left hand side. so I think u can add a render functino like render in column props but in row.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Somefunction = (record, props)=> return(<Dropdown item={onclick={function(record) , items:[...]}} trigger=['contextMenu']>{...props}</Dropdown)
