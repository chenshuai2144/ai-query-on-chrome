The issue with using `<ArrowLeftOutlined />` and `<ArrowRightOutlined />` as the prevArrow and nextArrow components in the `<Carousel>` component is that they do not have a `currentSlide` or `slideCount` property. To fix this, wrap the arrow buttons in another component, such as `<SlickButtonFix currentSlide slideCount>`, which will allow them to access the correct props.
