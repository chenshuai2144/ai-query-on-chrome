How did you use the comment to fix this? I'm getting a type error

```
Type '{ children: Element; }' is missing the following properties from type '{ [x: string]: any; currentSlide: any; slideCount: any; children: any; }': currentSlide, slideCount
```

edit: for posterity, turns out you just need to reference it like this, don't even need to set it to anything:

```
<Carousel
  arrows
  nextArrow={
    <SlickButtonFix currentSlide slideCount>
      <RightOutlined />
    </SlickButtonFix>
  }
  prevArrow={
    <SlickButtonFix currentSlide slideCount>
      <LeftOutlined />
    </SlickButtonFix>
  }
>
...
```
