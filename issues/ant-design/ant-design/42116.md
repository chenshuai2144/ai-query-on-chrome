This feature adds the 'duration' property to the useNotification hook configuration, allowing for custom duration settings for notifications. The current documentation recommends using the hook over the static method, but the hook is missing the 'duration' property, which is available in the static method configuration.
There is an issue with the 'placement' property in the codesandbox environment, and an example can be found here. The proposed API change is to replace notification.config() with notification.useNotification(), and include the 'duration' property in the configuration object. The 'duration' property is already included in the api.open() function, as shown in the attached image.
