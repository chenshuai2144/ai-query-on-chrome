### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-m70235)

### Steps to reproduce

There is no way to update fontWeight styling in button , it's hardcoded to 400.

Also observed the same in some more components like divider, where it's hardcoded to -500

### What is expected?

there should be a design token to update based on theme passed by user

### What is actually happening?

not able to update button font-weight based on values in theme provider

## MadCcc

There's no `fontWeight` token in current Design Token, and all components have default `font-weight` given by browser.
You could change `font-weight` in style of body or html.
And seems we should provide a new token `fontWeight` for Button to avoid breaking change

@MadCcc we should also do it for typography, tree as they are also hardcoded - fontWeight: 600 | fontWeight: 500

Try to use `fontWeightStrong` to customize. Didn't find other components hardcoded `font-weight` like Button.

Please check once in these files , i can see them hardcoded as below :

in file : antd/es/typography/style/mixins.js
`  strong: {
    fontWeight: 600
  },`

In file : antd/es/tree/style/index.js:

` 
[&:not(${treeNodeCls}-disabled).filter-node ${treeCls}-title]: {
          color: 'inherit',
          fontWeight: 500
        },`
