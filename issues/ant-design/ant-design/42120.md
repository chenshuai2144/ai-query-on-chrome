Button in Ant Design has a hardcoded font-weight of 400, which cannot be updated through props or theme. It also affects other components like Divider with a hardcoded font-weight of -500. To avoid breaking changes, it's suggested to add a fontWeight token to Ant Design's Design Token and customize Button's font-weight with it. Alternatively, you can try using fontWeightStrong to customize the font-weight of components that have been hardcoded.
