A bug in the `SpaceCompact` style causes icons to not blend properly with input elements when there are multiple inputs with different types and sizes. This issue can be reproduced in the provided CodeSandbox example and occurs in versions of Ant Design higher than v5.4.6. The expected behavior is for the icons to blend seamlessly with the input elements, while the current behavior results in the icons being separate from the input elements.
