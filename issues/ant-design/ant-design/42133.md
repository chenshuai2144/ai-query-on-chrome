# borderRadius not working as expected

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-jyh2k9)

### Steps to reproduce

As mentioned in antd design doc - we need to pass borderRadius as number
But we are not appending px at lot of places in antd so borderRadius is not applying properly

Refrence: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme

### What is expected?

It should append px (ideally it should be not be specific to px, should be generic )

### What is actually happening?

In file - https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/button/style/index.ts(line no: 421), we are directly getting borderRadius from token and applying to css, resulting in wrong styling.
