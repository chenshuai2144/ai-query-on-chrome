### Reproduction link

[https://gitlab.com/itpm-chat-bot/bot-frontend/-/blob/main/src/components/Messages/MessageCreateForm/ActionButtonRow/Modals/CreateActionBtnModal.jsx](https://gitlab.com/itpm-chat-bot/bot-frontend/-/blob/main/src/components/Messages/MessageCreateForm/ActionButtonRow/Modals/CreateActionBtnModal.jsx)

### Steps to reproduce

1. click okButton

### What is expected?

Trigger native validation

### What is actually happening?

Ignore native validation

| Environment | Info         |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| antd        | 5.4.2        |
| React       | 18.2.0       |
| System      | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Browser     | Chrome 111   |

---

I use react-hook-form for most validation cases, but it does not processes input type="url". I noticed that native submit button (type="submit") or antd Button (with props htmlType="submit") trigger native url validation, but okButton in Popconfirm component does not. I suspect the same behavior in other components such as Popover and so on

Try `getPopupContainer` to make sure `button (type="submit")` rendered inside form element.
