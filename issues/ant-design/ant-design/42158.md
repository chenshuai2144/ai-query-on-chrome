# DatePicker when used directly inside a Form.Item goes crazy and jumps to future years

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-ve0cit?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Clicking inside of the DatePicker shows all dates as selected and any further interaction will make the year jump to random years in the future.

- In my project, we use `moment` to format dates and I am using the DatePicker like this:

```
<Form.Item>
   <DatePicker />
</Form.Item>
```

I found out that wrapping the DatePicker in a div fixes the issue:

```
<Form.Item>
    <div>
         <DatePicker />
    </div>
</Form.Item>
```

In the CodeSandBox I provided, I am using the DatePicker the same way I do in my project, providing a value with `moment`, and the issue happens as well. However, wrapping it in a div doesn't solve the issue in this case.

### What is expected?

The DatePicker should not jump to random future years or select all dates when it opens.

### What is actually happening?

The DatePicker goes crazy and jumps to next years, and all the date squares appear as selected.
