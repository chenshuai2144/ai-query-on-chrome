Next.js version 13.4 adds support for server components in the app router, which solves the issue of antd components' styles not rendering correctly on the server side. The proposed API is to output CSS files, similar to what Antd recommends. However, one workaround is to extract a static CSS file using static-style-extract and load it in app/layout.tsx, but this is suboptimal due to the large size of the resulting CSS file. Another solution could be to generate CSS files based on the actual components used in the project or to use a registry with a use client approach similar to styled-jsx.
