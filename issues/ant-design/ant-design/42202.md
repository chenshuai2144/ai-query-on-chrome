# Customize Pagination style in antd

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I update antd from antd@4.19 to antd@5.x.x, and then the Pangination's style is changed.

I want to use the former Pagination style. How can I do it ? In other word, if I want Customize Pangination's styleï¼Œwhat should I do ?

### What does the proposed API look like?

Customize Pangination's style

I want to get antd@4.x.x's style in antd@5.x

This is expected, by design.

if you want the style of v4, you can customize the style.

If I want to do so, where can I learn about it?
I have tried to solve it in two ways.

1. the "itemRender" API of Pagination
2. Customize Theme in antd

they both doesn't work.
Can you tell me some correct methods?Thank you.

No need to Customize Theme or any api, directly use css to override the default style
