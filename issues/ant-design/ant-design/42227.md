The `Select` component's "Search and Select Users" demo is broken. Typing any text causes a list of items to appear, but only those that match the typed text show up in the results. If a previously displayed item is removed from the list, it cannot be selected again. The demo should display all available items, or indicate that no matches were found if no items match the typed text. The issue is caused by the fact that the demo uses a fake service to fetch data, which does not support filtering.
