The issue is that the `displayRender` prop in the Ant Design Cascader component only renders the content inside the Tag component, whereas the user may want to render their own custom UI for each selected option without using a Tag component. This inconsistency in behavior between single and multiple selection modes is considered a bug and should be fixed by allowing users to disable the default Tag component rendering through an optional `noTagParent` prop in the `displayRender` function.
