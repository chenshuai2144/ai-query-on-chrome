The `notification.destroy()` method is not working as expected. The notification does not disappear after 5 seconds, even though the function has been called. The issue may be related to the use of the `setTimeout()` function or the key used for the notification.
To troubleshoot this issue, you can try removing the `setTimeout()` function and seeing if the notification disappears after 5 seconds. Additionally, you can try using a different key for the notification to ensure that it is being properly destroyed. If neither of these solutions work, you may need to consult the documentation or seek help from the Ant Design community.
