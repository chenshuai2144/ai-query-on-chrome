"antd@4.24.10" environment causing "OnFieldsChange" to be called twice without the "validated" flag. Steps to reproduce: 1) clear terminal 2) input "3". Expected behavior: callback fires once with errors & "validated" flag as true. Actual behavior: callback fired twice w/o errors. Fixed in v5 but not in v4 due to rc-field-form issue. Can mitigate by upgrading to at least v4.17.3.
