The Ant Design Select component has a bug where it only accepts string values for its `mode` prop set to either `multiple` or `tags`. This causes issues when attempting to add tags to the component as well as displaying warnings in the console. The issue can be resolved by wrapping the Select component in an HOC that converts the value to a string before passing it to the Select component.
