# Nextjs 13 and Antd Layout Issue

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://github.com/PuckxPuck/back.git](https://github.com/PuckxPuck/back.git)

### Steps to reproduce

Install the NPM packages, view the first page

### What is expected?

Render the page with all the css and html, and not break

### What is actually happening?

for a few seconds while refreshing, the antd Content part goes on top of the sider part, I debugged a little and i saw the ant-layout-has-sider class loads after a few seconds

| Environment | Info                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| antd        | 5.4.7                  |
| React       | react/nextjs 13        |
| System      | 10.0.22621 Build 22621 |
| Browser     | Opera GX browser       |

At first the issue was the page loading before the antd style load, i fixed it by following this

@PuckxPuck You can tell the Layout component that Sider exists on the current page by explicitly specifying the 'hasSider' prop

@kiner-tang is right.

@kiner-tang In this case, the Link in production breaks while works fine in local machine, clicking on the Link gives errors
