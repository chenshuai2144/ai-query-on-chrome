Antd Layout issue with Next.js 13, page loads with broken CSS and HTML for a few seconds before the antd style loads. The issue can be resolved by explicitly specifying the 'hasSider' prop to the Layout component. However, in some cases, the Link component in production breaks while working fine in local machine.
