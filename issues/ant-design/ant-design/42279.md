The "beforeUpload" hook in Ant Design's Upload component is not working as expected when uploading files larger than 2MB. The issue can be reproduced by uploading a file larger than 2MB using the Upload Dragger. Currently, the file does not upload, but an error message is displayed. To fix this issue, you can try adding a custom "onSuccess" callback function that handles the successful upload of large files.
