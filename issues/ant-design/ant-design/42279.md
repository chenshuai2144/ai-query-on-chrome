The beforeUpload function is not working properly in the Upload Dragger component when uploading files larger than 2MB. The expected behavior is that the file should be uploaded, but instead, an error message is displayed. The issue can be reproduced by uploading a file larger than 2MB to the Upload Dragger component. The error message is not being passed to the onChange method, and the file is not being uploaded. The issue has been reported in the antd repository and a CodeSandbox link has been provided for reference.
