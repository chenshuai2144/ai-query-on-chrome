# Form.List label pushes form items after the first down

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/form#components-form-demo-dynamic-form-item](https://ant.design/components/form#components-form-demo-dynamic-form-item)

### Steps to reproduce

Add `labelWrap` to the form and make the label for the item longer.

### What is expected?

It would be perfect if the items all stay equal distance from each other.

### What is actually happening?

Because the label wraps to new line and its height becomes greater than the form item's, a big gap will be left between the first and the subsequent items.

This is only a demo. You can put ReactNode in `label` to customize this part. Follow code only handle the horizontal style. You need do the vertical responsive style self of it:
