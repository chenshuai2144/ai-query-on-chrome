The `Form.List` component in Ant Design v5.4.7 has a bug where adding a `labelWrap` to the form and making the label for an item longer causes a large gap to appear between the first and subsequent items. This occurs because the label wraps to a new line and its height becomes greater than the form item's, causing the items to be further apart. To fix this, you can customize the vertical responsive style of the form item yourself.
