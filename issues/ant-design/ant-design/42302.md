In the reproduction link provided, the issue seems to be that the `useApp` hook is not being used correctly in the request interceptor. The `useApp` hook is used to access the `message` component, which is used to display messages to the user. However, in the reproduction link, the `useApp` hook is not being passed the correct context, which is causing the `message` component to not be displayed correctly.
To fix this issue, you can pass the correct context to the `useApp` hook when it is used in the request interceptor. You can do this by creating a new context object that contains the necessary information, and then passing this context object to the `useApp` hook. This will ensure that the `message` component is displayed correctly, regardless of the version of the browser being used.
