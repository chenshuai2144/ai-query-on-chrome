In order to solve the problem that the message component does not work in axios request interceptors due to the "useApp" method not being able to be used when the browser version is lower than the specified requirements, one solution is to use the "@ant-design/static-style-extract" package to extract CSS files for message components only and then import them in axios request interceptors. Another solution is to wrap the call to the "useApp" method in an event listener on the "message" event in the App component and emit the message to the event manually.
