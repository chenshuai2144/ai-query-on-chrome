# Dropdown's "autoAdjustOverflow" doesn't work

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ckyouq?file=demo.tsx,package.json](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ckyouq?file=demo.tsx,package.json)

### Steps to reproduce

- create a dropdown with some text in it. Make the dropdown be bigger than the button
- set the placement for the Dropdown to `bottom`

```
  <Dropdown
    menu={{
      items: [
        {
          key: '1',
          label: (
            <a
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://www.antgroup.com"
            >
              This is a very big dropdown
            </a>
          ),
        },
      ],
    }}
    placement="bottom"
  >
    <Button>bottom</Button>
  </Dropdown>
```

### What is expected?

The Dropdown has the `autoAdjustOverflow` attribute `true` by default and it is expected to make the full dropdown visible on the page when it overflows. I think `autoAdjustOverflow={true}` should ignore the `placement="bottom"` if the dropdown is off screen.

### What is actually happening?

the dropdown is off screen
