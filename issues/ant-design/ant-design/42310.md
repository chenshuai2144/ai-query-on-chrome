This proposal adds the `draggable` prop to the `<Tree>` component, allowing developers to specify which nodes within the tree should be draggable or not. This solves the problem of wanting to remove the drag functionality from certain nodes within the tree. The API for this feature is as follows:

```javascript
<Tree treeData={treeNodes} draggable />
```

where `treeNodes` is an array of objects representing the tree nodes with properties such as `title`, `key`, and `draggable`. The `draggable` property can be set to `false` for nodes that should not be draggable.
