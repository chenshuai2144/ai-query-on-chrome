# Add draggable attribute to Tree Node.

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I want to eliminate the drag function of some Tree nodes and i want to specify which nodes are not draggable.

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
const treeNodes = [{
title: 'Node 1',
key: 'node1',
...
draggable: false
}, {
title: 'Node 2',
key: 'node2',
...
draggable: true
}];

<Tree treeData={treeNodes} draggable />
```
