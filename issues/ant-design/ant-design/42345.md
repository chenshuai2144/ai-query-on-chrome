# Typography Editable onEnd not being called onBlur

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/interactive-antd-5-4-7-forked-56tp8r)

### Steps to reproduce

- Pass `onStart`, `onEnd` and `onCancel` to `editable` config of `Typography`
- `onStart` is called when clicking on element
- `onCancel` is called when canceling with ESC
- `onEnd` is called when confirming with ENTER
- when confirming and leaving editing is done by clicking outside of element (onBlur), no callback is being called. This action is identical to pressing ENTER and therefor should also trigger `onEnd` callback

### What is expected?

Call `onEnd` when leaving editing with onBlur

### What is actually happening?

It is impossible to act on onBlur

It's by design. Since if `onEnd` trigger `onBlur`, `onEnd` is nothing different with `onChange`:
