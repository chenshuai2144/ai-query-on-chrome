An issue with the `onEnd` prop in the `onBlur` event handler of an editable `Typography` component occurs in `antd` version 5.4.7. The `onEnd` callback is not called when confirming an edit by clicking outside of the element, even though the behavior is expected and `onEnd` is intended to be triggered in this situation. This makes it impossible to perform any actions after confirming an edit by clicking outside of the element. The issue affects all versions of React and browsers.
