I think your article is a good solutionüëçüòÑ
This part of the job should not be done by `field form`
antd form gives developers the freedom to toggle errors content as you do in your article

Form trigger validate by the `validateTrigger` config. Which means it will not updated by the locale modification. I think we can add config to re-validate touched field.
