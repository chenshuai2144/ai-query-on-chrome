# ant-layout-header css doesnt allow overriding it's css

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://codepen.io/pen](https://codepen.io/pen)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Using emotion's css i gave css to Header component of antd and passed a css that i exported from my ts file.
2. I defined the background color to white. But my background color is being overwritten by the default ant-layout-header 's style. i.e. background: #001529;

### What is expected?

I want to be able to overwrite the css of ant-layout-header easily without needing to use !important.

### What is actually happening?

It is compelling me to use !important since the css is not overriding.
