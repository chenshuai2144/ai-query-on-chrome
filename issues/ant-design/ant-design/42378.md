"Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component" error when rendering <Menu /> component twice. This is caused by using the same component in multiple components and navigating between them. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function. Upgrading to react18 may solve the problem, but it may affect other libraries.
