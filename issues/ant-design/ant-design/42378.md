Using `<CustomMenu>` component in multiple components can cause a memory leak due to React updating the component state even after it has been unmounted. This can be resolved by upgrading to React 18 which does not show the warning for updating state on an unmounted component. However, this upgrade may affect other libraries used in the project.
