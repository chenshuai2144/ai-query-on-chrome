# AutoComplete confusing scroll disappearing on search

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

The problem is that when I click on the AutoComplete input the drop-down options are displayed but the scroll disappears after a few seconds. It causes confusion for users who think that not all options are loaded. This is especially disadvantageous in cases where the search is run dynamically.

To visualize the disappearing scroll problem (without dynamic search) you can check the code sandbox:
https://codesandbox.io/s/autocomplete-antd-5-4-5-forked-bzu7ff?file=/demo.tsx

1. After Click on the input to see the drop-down options with the scroll visible.
2. Wait a few seconds.

P.S. Copied from the bug (https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/42016) but changed into feature request.

### What does the proposed API look like?

It would be nice to add a flag to never hide scroll when needed.
showScroll?: boolean;
<AutoComplete showScroll (...) />

Thanks for feedback. Since this will affect out design, it may not confirm to apply this requirement. But to enable developer to handle this. We've patch the `className` of scrollbar which you can modify style:
