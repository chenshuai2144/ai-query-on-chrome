AntD 5.x styles do not work in production mode in Next.js with React 18 and Windows. The issue can be reproduced by visiting <http://121.43.189.236:3000/material_manager>. The expected behavior is that the styles should be displayed correctly, but in the actual behavior, the styles are missing. The issue has been reported in an environment with AntD 5.1.6. The issue can be resolved by removing the use of ConfigerProvider to customize the theme.
