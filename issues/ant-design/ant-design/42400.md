The "onSelect" event in the Ant Design Calendar component is logging both the previously selected day and the newly selected day when the month changes. This behavior can be reproduced in the reproduction link provided. The expected behavior is for the "onSelect" event to only run when the user clicks on a specific day, not when the month changes.
