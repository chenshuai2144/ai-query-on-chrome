The `tabList` in `Card` does not accept the `closeable` prop. The expected behavior is that when `closeable` is set to `false`, the close icon should not appear. However, the close icon is still showing. This issue is related to the `tabsProps` of `Card` and needs to be migrated in the next minor version.
