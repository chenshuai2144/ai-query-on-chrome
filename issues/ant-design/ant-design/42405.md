The "tabList" component in Ant Design's "Card" doesn't accept the "closeable" prop. The reproduction link is provided, and it shows how to set "closeable" to false on a "tabListItem". However, the close icon still appears on the tab. This issue may need to be migrated to a minor version in order to align with the behavior of the "tabs" component.
