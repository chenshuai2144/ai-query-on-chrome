A mobile form on `yourimageshare.com/ib/tHpRPvBvWb` and `yourimageshare.com/ib/CGom5pTMu2` is not responsive due to CSS margin override in mobile view. The form is valid in label items but is displaying errors in mobile view. The issue is reproducible and can be resolved by removing the CSS margin override. The environment includes Ant Design 5.4.2, React 18.2.0, Windows 11, and Chrome 113.0.5672.93.
