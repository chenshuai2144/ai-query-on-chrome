This appears to be an issue with `@rc-component/color-picker` and its dependencies. It looks like there may be a mismatch between the versions of the dependencies that are being used and the versions that were intended for the package.
One solution could be to update the dependencies of `@rc-component/color-picker` to the latest version. This could potentially resolve any compatibility issues that may be causing the error.
Alternatively, you could try using a different color picker component or library that is known to work well with your setup. This would allow you to avoid the issue altogether.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
