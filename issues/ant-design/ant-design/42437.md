It seems that the issue is caused by the dependency `@rc-component/color-picker` not being compatible with the version of React and Ant Design being used. To resolve the issue, you can try downgrading the version of `@rc-component/color-picker` to 1.0.0 or wait for a patch update from the Ant Design team.
