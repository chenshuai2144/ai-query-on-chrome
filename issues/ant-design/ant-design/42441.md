Menu not re-rendering after click, updating data in table, changing component styles. Reproduction link: <https://codesandbox.io/s/k-doc-phvkll?file=/src/pages/directories/names/index.tsx> Steps to reproduce: 1. Click on any menu item 2. Press "Directories names" menu item 3. Press the add button, 4. Fill in the fields 5. Press ok What is expected: Menu not rerendering. Adding data and rendering table with updated data What is actually happening: The fact is that now, on such a basic example, everything is done as it should, adding and updating the table is correct. On my working project, I am fetching data from a database in the fetchDataTable function and populating it in setDataTable. After filling out the form, I send the data to the server and add it to the database, after which I call the fetchDataTable function again to get the actual data from the database (the handleOk function in the Modal component). But my props.fetch() is executed for some reason earlier than props.form?.submit() although it is after. I read that form.submit() can take some time to complete and therefore is executed after props.fetch(), how can I fix this, all my options turned out to be not working | Environment | Info | antd | 5.4.0 | React | 18.2.0 | System | windows 1909 | Browser | Google Chrome 112.0.5615.138 |
