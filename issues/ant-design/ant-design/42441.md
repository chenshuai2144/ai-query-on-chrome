A React menu rendering issue occurs where the menu is re-rendered after clicking on an item and the table does not update until the page is refreshed. This is due to the `fetchDataTable` function being called before the form submission has completed, preventing the table from being updated. Moving the function call inside the `handleOk` function in the Modal component can solve this. Additionally, the issue arises because the menu is being re-rendered every time a page is navigated to, which can be prevented by setting the `rootReducer.route` level to a value outside of the sub routes. To change the styles of components, use the built-in CSS-in-JS system in Ant Design.
