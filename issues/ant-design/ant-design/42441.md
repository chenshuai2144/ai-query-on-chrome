# Menu rerender after click, updating data in the table, changing component styles

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/k-doc-phvkll?file=/src/pages/directories/names/index.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

//For menu rerender after click

1. Click on any menu item

// For updating data

1. Press "Directories names" menu item
2. Press the add button,
3. Fill in the fields
4. Press ok

### What is expected?

Menu not rerendering. Adding data and rendering table with updated data

### What is actually happening?

The fact is that now, on such a basic example, everything is done as it should, adding and updating the table is correct.
On my working project, I am fetching data from a database in the fetchDataTable function and populating it in setDataTable. After filling out the form, I send the data to the server and add it to the database, after which I call the fetchDataTable function again to get the actual data from the database (the handleOk function in the Modal component). But my props.fetch() is executed for some reason earlier than props.form?.submit() although it is after. I read that form.submit() can take some time to complete and therefore is executed after props.fetch(), how can I fix this, all my options turned out to be not working

Also, after each click on the menu, it is recreated, how to make sure that the menu is not re-rendered when switching between pages?
Also, the question is how to change the styles of the components, in my case, these are changes in the style of the modal window buttons on hover.
In styles.module.scss file i changed button styles with :global but it didn't help

I will be grateful for your help

Could someone help me with these questions?

#### For route

This is not related with antd. I think its better to check the react router doc for more info. Route can config with level. Your root layout should out of sub route instead of re-render with each route.

#### For style

cssinjs style is dynamic generated. You must not override the hashed css selector. That's why we named it as **`.css-dev-only-do-not-override`** (css dev only, do not override). For how to affect style, you can view some Chrome dev guide for this: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/

PS: github issue is trace the bug or feature request. Usage or web development question is not a better place here. You can ask it in https://stackoverflow.com/ instead.
