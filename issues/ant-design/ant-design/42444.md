The antd table filter menu in default mode color doesn't have any differences between the body and the footer color of the filter menu. so the rounded border is not apparent in the default mode. but in the dark mode, the footer color is different from the body color on the table filter menu. that is why there is difference in bottom border.

Changing its `border-radius` in the filter drop-down menu of the table should fix the problem here. Just like this:
