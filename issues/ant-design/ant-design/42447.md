A ConfigProvider for library based on antd is needed to override font family in components, but it is not possible to specify theme overrides during the build for each component separately. A webpack plugin that accepts props to be overriden for theme could be proposed. Alternatively, a custom lib could be created to wrap all Antd components and use a ConfigProvider with theme tokens.
