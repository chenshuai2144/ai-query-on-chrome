Bug found in Ant Design version 5.5.0: In inline forms, when there are multiple input elements, they are not separated by a margin-bottom. This behavior is different from version 4.24.10.
Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to reproduction link provided: [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/form-layout-antd-5-5-0-forked-6gdxgs?file=/demo.js)
2. Run the code
   Expected result: The margin-bottom should be present between multiple input elements in an inline form, just like in version 4.24.10.
   Actual result: In version 5.5.0, the margin-bottom is missing between multiple input elements in an inline form, resulting in them being merged together.
   Environment information:

- Ant Design version: 5.5.0
- React version: 18
- Operating system: macOS
- Browser: Chrome

This issue does not occur in version 4.24.10.
