# Sometimes render component without style.

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### Steps to reproduce

sometimes, navigating

### What is actually happening?

Sometimes, when switching between screens, a component's style doesn't load.
For example, on a screen using a Button component, the button will render like a pure html button with no styles applied.

The logic of CSS-IN-JS seems to declare the following style in the header of the component used in the screen, but sometimes it doesn't work that way.

<style data-rc-order="prependQueue" data-css-hash="1tm4gwl" data-token-hash="1tzbqhu"> <style data-rc-order="prependQueue" data-css-hash="1tm4gwl

I am using the primary color in index.js by setting it via ConfigProvider.
