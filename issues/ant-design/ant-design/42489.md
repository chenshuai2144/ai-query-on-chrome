Bug: select, close buttons not vertically centered. Attempting to fix by changing line-height and tag height. MadCcc: After removing border, the text still appears too high, as the line-height remains 22px while the tag is set to 22px. Suggestion: either adjust the text line-height to match the tag or remove the border entirely.
