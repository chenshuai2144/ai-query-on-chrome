"A bug in Sortable Tags causes the onClose event to not fire when the close icon is clicked. This issue can be reproduced by clicking the close icon on a tag. The expected behavior is for the event to fire and log something, but instead, nothing happens. The problem appears to be caused by an `onPointerDown` listener added to the component's `props` that stops event bubbling up. A potential solution is to remove the `onPointerDown` listener or use a different approach."
