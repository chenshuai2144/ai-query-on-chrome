# Sortable Tags close event not firing

Clicking the close icon on a tag does not trigger the expected `onClose` event. This issue can be reproduced in the CodeSandbox reproduction link provided. The expected behavior is for the event to be fired, but it is not.

The issue is caused by the `onPointerDown` listener in the `listeners` object, which stops event propagation. A workaround is to remove the `onPointerDown` listener or add a `onPointerUp` listener to allow event propagation.
