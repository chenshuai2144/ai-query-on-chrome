## Symptoms

## Reproduction

- [x] Dropdown arrow issue: <https://codesandbox.io/s/tu-biao-an-niu-antd-5-5-0-forked-601t1q?file=/demo.tsx>

## Cause

- Icon margin is missing on the right side of the button due to a bug in the latest version of Ant Design.
- Dropdown arrow is too large on the right side of the button due to a change in the way Ant Design handles icon size.

## Solution

- Use an older version of Ant Design that does not have the bug.
- Use the `icon` prop to specify the size of the icon, or use the `span` element to wrap the icon and set its size manually.
