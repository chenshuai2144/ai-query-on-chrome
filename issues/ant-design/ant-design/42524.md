# How to distinguish between on click outside(Blur) or Enter Click in Editable Typography ?

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

https://ant.design/components/typography#editable

editable
{
icon: ReactNode,
tooltip: boolean | ReactNode,
editing: boolean,
maxLength: number,
autoSize: boolean | { minRows: number, maxRows: number },
text: string,
onChange: function(string),
onCancel: function,
onStart: function,
onEnd: function,
triggerType: ('icon' | 'text')[],
enterIcon: ReactNode,
}

In Editable Typography we have above feature, onChange is getting called on Click outside (Blur) or enter Click and its returning only the string not any events. The event which called the onChange will help in doing separate functions of click of enter and on blur with the return string

### What does the proposed API look like?

onChange should return the string along with the type of event

`onEnd` only trigger when confirm by enter but not trigger when click outside of blur. You do like this to only accept enter confirm:

@zombieJ I want to update both on confirm by enter or clicking out but along with value I want the event also which triggered that confirm because I wanted to do 2 different type of operation on click of enter and clicking out

我也需要blur事件来保存内容
