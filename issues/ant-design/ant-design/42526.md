Bug in Ant Design Dropdown component where it glitches when triggered by clicking the Trigger element and the Open state is changed from another click. Can be reproduced using the provided StackBlitz link. Repro steps: add Dropdown with trigger(['click']) and a state to track its open state; add a button that toggles the Dropdown's open state to true. Expected behavior: Dropdown should not glitch and behave the same as Dropdown without trigger(['click']). Actual behavior: Dropdown glitches. Environment: antd 5.5.1, React 18.2.0, MacOS Ventura 13.0.1, Browser 113. To fix, don't use `setOpen` in both `onOpenChange` and Button. Instead, use this code: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-s4prys-ea1bfq?file=demo.tsx. Alternatively, if you want the "click outside dropdown to close the dropdown" feature, use a different trigger, such as `clickOutside`, which will automatically close the Dropdown when clicked outside of it.
