Ant Design's default tooltip arrow styling is incorrect in version 5. It renders as a rectangle or square instead of a pointy shape. Steps to reproduce include using a Tooltip component in the app. Expected behavior is a pointy-shaped arrow like in version 4, but the current implementation is rectangular with broken CSS. Environment includes antd 5.5.1, react 17.0.2, macOS Ventura 13.3.1, and Chrome Version 113.0.5672.63. This issue was discovered during an upgrade from v4 to v5.
