"Spin in Badge component rotates too fast" - Bug in Spin component causing it to rotate too quickly. Reproducible in CodeSandbox and occurs when using a Spin in a Badge component with a "count" property. Expected behavior is for the Spin component to rotate at a lower speed, as described in the documentation. Environment includes antd 5.5.1, React 18.2.0, Windows 11/Ubuntu, and Chrome/Brave. The issue can be resolved by removing the animation override.
