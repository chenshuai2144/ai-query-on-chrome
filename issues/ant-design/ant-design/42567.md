Feature proposal: Set validateFirst as the default behavior for Form.Item rules to simplify validation and align with common usage. Currently, the default value for validateFirst is false, but in most cases, validating only the first rule is more convenient. The proposed API allows developers to easily configure Form.Item rules with validateFirst.
