# Form.Item.useStatus does not work for custom inputs wrapped in Form.Item noStyle=true

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-ylspzx?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

enter text to first name or last name and delete the text

### What is expected?

1. That the Form.Item with noStyle={false} will show the error of one of the inputs below
2. That the "status shower" will show the error that is coming from any of the fields (which is getting its data from useStatus)

### What is actually happening?

1. That the Form.Item with noStyle={false} does show the error of one of the inputs below as expected
2. That the "status shower" does not show the error that is coming from any of the fields

It is intended that `noStyle` will clean status of Form.Item. Any special usage?

## tamir-lavi-ns

I get that you cannot get the status inside the Form.Item with the `noStyle`, but just as the parent Form.Item with `noStyle={false}` still shows the error message of the noStyle child. I still expect you would get the status and errors in the hierarchy below the parent Form.Item that has style, just as the parent shows the error message. Just to clarify, I do not mean that the status should return under the context of the child, just the parent until the child starts

An example too this you can see in my recreation of the condition under the “status shower:” rendered result
