The `Drawer` component in version 5.x of Ant Design does not trigger DOM events such as `onMouseEnter` or `onClick`. This issue has been reported and someone is currently working on it. The reproduction link can be found [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/confident-dew-y8ug15). The problem occurs when using these events on a `Drawer` component. The expected behavior is for the DOM events to be triggered, but they are not. This bug was identified in versions 5.5.1 of Ant Design and earlier, as well as in the latest stable version (as of writing) which is 5.6.3.
