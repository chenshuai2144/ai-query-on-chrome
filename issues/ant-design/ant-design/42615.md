The Drawer component in antd does not currently support DOM events such as onMouseEnter or onClick. This is a known issue and is being worked on. A reproduction link and steps to reproduce are provided in the original post. The expected behavior is for DOM events to be triggered, but they are not currently working. The issue was reported in version 5.5.1 of antd and is present in at least version 5.5.1.
