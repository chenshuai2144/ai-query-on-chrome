## Reproduction Link

[CodeSandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-tailwind-forked-1b9nhr?file=/pages/index.js)

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the reproduction link
2. View the generated output on the right side browser
3. Inspect the code and check where the 'flex-grow' class is being inserted (needed in the same div's classname where ant-space-item is added)

## What is Expected?

The 'flex-grow' tailwind class name should be added to the ant-space-item instead of the child div.

## What is Actually Happening?

The 'flex-grow' tailwind class name is being added to the child div of the ant-space-item.

## Environment

| Environment | Info   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| antd        | 5.5.0  |
| React       | 18.2.0 |
| System      | Mac    |
| Browser     | Chrome |

## Additional Context

This feature request is for those using Tailwind CSS who want to customize the styles of the auto-generated classes in Ant Design components. Currently, it is not possible to pass a className to the direct auto-generated classes of Ant Design components.
