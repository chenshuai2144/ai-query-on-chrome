# Unpredictable behaviour of a draggable track slider

`üêõ Bug`

### Reproduction link

https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-6n0wd2

### Steps to reproduce

Try to click and drag the selected interval a couple of times.

### What is expected?

There should be some fixed maximum distance (could be a percentage of the selected interval or an absolute value in pixels) which controls whether the endpoint should be moved or the entire interval should be dragged.

### What is actually happening?

You will notice that sometimes it's draggable and sometimes one of the end positions moves onto where you clicked.

Sure, I updated the issue with a new reproduction link: https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-6n0wd2

It seems this is actually a problem with the underlying "rc-slider"

I posted an issue there https://github.com/react-component/slider/issues/907
