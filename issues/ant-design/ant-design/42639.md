"Build Error" in Next.js after upgrading to React 18.0.0 and @next/react version v5.5.1. The issue is related to the import statement for RcMenuItemProps, which is causing a '?' expected error. To resolve the issue, update the import statement to use "import \* as RcMenu from 'rc-menu'" instead of "import type { RcMenuItemProps as RcMenuItemProps } from 'rc-menu'".
