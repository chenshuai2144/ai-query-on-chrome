The problem is that the `handleBeforeUpload` function is not updating the state correctly when a new file is selected in the upload dialog. The `beforeUpload` function is only called once when the dialog is first opened, and the state is not being updated when a new file is selected. To fix this, you can add a callback function to the `customRequest` prop of the `Dragger` component that updates the state with the new file information.
