# Modal open prop not passed to child component in 4.24.10 version

### Reproduction link: <https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-s4h6ih?file=/InsideModal.jsx>

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a modal component using Ant Design.
2. Add a child component inside the modal.
3. Try to log the `visible` prop of the parent component inside the child component. It will not change even if the parent component's `visible` prop changes.

### Expected behavior:

The `visible` prop of the parent component should change according to its value.

### Actual behavior:

The `visible` prop of the parent component does not change even if its value changes.

### Environment:

| Environment | Info                  |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| antd        | 4.24.10               |
| React       | 17.0.1                |
| System      | mac 12.6              |
| Browser     | chrome 113.0.5672.126 |

### Solution:

You can add the `forceRender` prop to the child component to keep its state alive after the modal is closed.
