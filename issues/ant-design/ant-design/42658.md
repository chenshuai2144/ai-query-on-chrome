There is an issue where the `visible` prop does not change correctly in a modal component created using Ant Design version 4.24.10. When adding a child component to the modal, trying to log the `visible` prop from the parent component does not reflect the changes made to the parent prop. The expected behavior is for the `visible` prop to change according to the value of the parent prop, but the actual behavior is that the `visible` prop remains constant regardless of changes to the parent prop. One possible solution is to add the `forceRender` prop to the child component, which keeps the modal context alive and allows the child component to receive updates.
