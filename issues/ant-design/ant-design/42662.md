## Reproduction link

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-uyahvw?file=demo.tsx](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-uyahvw?file=demo.tsx)

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open the reproduction and try typing anything without uppercase, the text will still be lowercased.
2. Remove the suffix from "input1" and the addonAfter from "input2", type again without uppercase, the text will be uppercased.

## What is expected?

The uppercase transform should be applied to the input elements even with suffix and addOnAfter.

## What is actually happening?

The uppercase transform is not being applied.
