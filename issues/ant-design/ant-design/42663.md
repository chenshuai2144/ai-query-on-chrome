The TreeSelect component's keyboard navigation has inconsistent focusing, where the top value of the tree is being highlighted even when selecting different options using the keyboard. This issue also occurs when mixing hover with keyboard navigation. The problem can be resolved by implementing the proper WAI-ARIA roles and states for the TreeSelect component to ensure consistent focusing across all methods of interaction.
