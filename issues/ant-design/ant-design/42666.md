In a Meteor build environment, when adding Antd to a fresh project, a TypeError occurs when trying to use the ColorPicker component. The error message is "convertHsb2Hsv is not a function" and is caused by a circular reference in the color.ts file of the ColorPicker component. To fix the issue, use the latest release of the ColorPicker component, which can be found in the releases tab of the repository.
