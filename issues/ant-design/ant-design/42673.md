Container with affix does not work properly when it is fixed to the top of the page and there is no scrollable content below it. The issue can be reproduced by setting `container: document.getElementById('target')` in the affix options and then scrolling down the page. The affixed element should not move when scrolling but instead stay at the top of the page. However, in this case, the element moves along with the rest of the page due to the window scroll event.
