Ant Design's `Upload` component does not properly announce its progress in VoiceOver on Mac OS Ventura. This issue can be reproduced by opening the "Default Files" example in a new window and using VoiceOver to navigate to the first item in the file list with a progress bar. The element should announce both the progress and the associated label, but it currently announces only "indeterminate, progress indicator." I have identified the cause of this issue and am working on a fix, which I will submit as a pull request shortly.
