# placement property for Select component not working

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-mclean-s9huus?file=/src/App.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Use the placement property at "bottomLeft" with a Select component. Click on the Select and scroll up and down, options position should cahnge.

### What is expected?

It's expected that if a placement property is given to the Select component, the options should be fixed at the indicated placement.

### What is actually happening?

If bottomLeft is passed, it sometimes goes to a topLeft placement.

On the doc of the Select component (https://ant.design/components/select) in the example about the placement, if you select any placement and scroll the position changes and is not the one that's been selected.

you can set `dropdownAlign={{ overflow: { adjustX: false, adjustY: false } }}`

@MadCcc 这个 api 是文档漏了还是怎么。

文档中没有透出的属性属于非标特性。目前可以通过 ConfigProvider 的 `popupOverflow` 设置弹层的响应区域 https://ant.design/components/config-provider#api

Props that not written in docs is not stable. Currently you could use `popupOverflow` in ConfigProvider to set responsive area for popups: https://ant.design/components/config-provider#api
