The issue is that the Select component's placement property does not work as expected. If the placement is set to "bottomLeft", the options may occasionally change to "topLeft". The problem can be solved by setting the dropdownAlign prop to an object with adjustX and adjustY set to false. This will prevent the options from moving when scrolling. It is recommended to check the ConfigProvider component for other non-standard props that may solve this issue.
