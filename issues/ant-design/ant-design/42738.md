[https://codepen.io/erick_gmachado/pen/VwEOVrx?editors=0010](https://codepen.io/erick_gmachado/pen/VwEOVrx?editors=0010)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a field;
2. Click on "Validate fields" button. Nothing happens;
3. Go to line 61 and remove the argument ["users"] from form.validateFields;
4. Add another field and hit "Validate fields" button. Now the fields are validated;

### What is expected?

It's expected to be able to validate dynamic field programmatically through form hook method.

### What is actually happening?

Dynamic form fields are not being validated when dynamic field name is specified

Form.List also support `rules`, your validation is trigger on the list instead of field. Give the path you want to validate instead:

@zombieJ in the sandbox you provided, is there another way to validate all form items in a form list field?
From the sandbox:

```
form.getFieldValue(["users"]).forEach((_, index) => {
    valdiatedFields.push(["users", index, "first"]);
    valdiatedFields.push(["users", index, "last"]);
});
```

Why couldn't I just do `form.validateFields([["users", index]])` and it would validate all fields for the field "users" at given index?

My use case is that next to each field row there is a button to be able to save fields individually. If I click on this button, I would like only this single field row to be validated.
