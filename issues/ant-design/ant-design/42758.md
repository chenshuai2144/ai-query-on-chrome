This is an error message indicating that you are trying to use the `import` statement outside of a module in the file `TextArea.js` from the `antd` library. This error occurs when you are trying to import a module that is not in the same directory as the file where you are trying to import it. To fix this error, you should move the `TextArea.js` file to the same directory as the file where you are trying to import it, or you can import it using a relative path.
