The error message "Cannot use import statement outside a module" occurs when you try to use an import statement in a JavaScript file that is not part of an ES module.
ES modules are a new feature in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allow you to create self-contained units of code that can be imported and exported between other modules. These modules are defined using the `export` keyword and can be imported using the `import` keyword.
To fix this error, make sure that the file containing the import statement is an ES module. If the file is not an ES module, you need to change its extension to `.mjs`. You can also use tools like Babel or Webpack to convert your existing files to ES modules.
