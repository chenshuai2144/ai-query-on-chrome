`DefaultFilteredValue` not working in antd 5.5.2. The controlled property `value` takes priority over the uncontrolled property `defaultValue`. Reproduced in CodePen: <https://codepen.io/RangrasJay/pen/mdzZQWx?editors=001>. Expected: default value to be populated. Actually happening: no default value is populated. Environment: antd 5.5.2, React 17, Windows, Chrome.
