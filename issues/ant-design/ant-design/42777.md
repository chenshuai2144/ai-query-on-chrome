antd's `DefaultFilteredValue` component doesn't work as expected in controlled input elements when a controlled property (`value`) has been set and takes precedence over an uncontrolled property (`defaultValue`). This issue can be reproduced in the provided CodePen link. The expected behavior is that the default value should populate the input field, but instead no default value is displayed. The environment information indicates that Ant Design version 5.5.2, React version 17, and Chrome browser are being used on a Windows system.
