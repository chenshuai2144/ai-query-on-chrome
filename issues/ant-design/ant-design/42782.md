A transfer bug occurs when resetting data. The issue can be reproduced by following these steps:

1. Select all items from the left list and transfer them to the right list.
2. Click on the checkbox on top of the second list to select all items.
3. Click on the right or left reload button.

Expected behavior: The number of selected items in the right list should match the number of items in the list.
Actual behavior: There is a discrepancy between the number of selected items in the right list and the actual count, resulting in a misleading selection count of 20/10. This bug occurs in version 5.5.2 of Ant Design using React 16 with a Windows 11 system and Chrome browser.
