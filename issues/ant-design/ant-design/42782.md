# Transfer bug when resetting data

`üêõ Bug`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/transfer#components-transfer-demo-advanced](https://ant.design/components/transfer#components-transfer-demo-advanced)

### Steps to reproduce

Open the link, go to advanced section.

1. select all from left list and transfer it to the right list
2. click on the checkbox on top of the second list to select all the items
3. click on the right (or left) reload button

### What is expected?

in the list on the right I expect the number of selected to be consistent with the number of items in the list.

### What is actually happening?

there is a 20/10 selected, which is misleading and incorrect.
