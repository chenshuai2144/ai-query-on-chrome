A bug exists in antd version 5.5.2 where the initialValue for the ColorPicker component is not being properly set, even when passed through the ref or initialValue prop in the Form.Item component. This issue can be reproduced by importing ColorPicker and Form from antd@5.5.2, creating a custom ColorPicker component, wrapping it in a Form.Item, and attempting to set the initialValue either through the ref or initialValue prop. The expected behavior is for the ColorPicker component to receive the initial value, but instead, no value is being set.
