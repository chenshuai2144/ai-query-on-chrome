The initial value of the ColorPicker component is not working when used in a Form component with Form.Item. This issue can be reproduced by importing ColorPicker and Form from antd@5.5.2, creating a custom ColorPicker component using antd's ColorPicker component, wrapping the ColorPicker component inside of a Form.Item component, and wrapping all components in a Form component. The expected behavior is for the initial value to be set to the ColorPicker component, but the actual behavior is that the initial value is not being set. This issue can be resolved by passing the value to the ColorPicker component.
