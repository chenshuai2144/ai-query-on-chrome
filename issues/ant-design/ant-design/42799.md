# Notification global config is not applied

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/notification-global-config-issue-jsojb4?file=/AntdConfigProvider.js)

### Steps to reproduce

1. set ConfigProvider for whole app
2. at the same file call notification global method .config()
3. create some component and insert in app
4. get api and context holder in some component
5. call notification

### What is expected?

I expect that notification global config will be applied to all notifications in app components

### What is actually happening?

notification global config is ignored

@evgeniyworkbel  
hello bro
`Notification.config` seems can't be used in` notificationapi.useNotification(config)` instance
i am asking the antd core member whether is is designed for it
if you need the global config, you can use it following this demo, but it will use Notification static api

@BoyYangzai thank u for your detail explanation, bro. I will consider your suggestion about static notification methods. And I'm looking forward to see answer that you're asking the antd core member

@BoyYangzai bro, did you get answer from the antd core member?

all static config (e.g. `notification.config` `message.config` `ConfigProvider.config`) is used for static method (e.g. `notification.open` `message.success` `Modal.confirm`).

Here is some history. In prev antd version, we provide static method which can not consume ConfigProvider context. It's bad since can not sync with React life cycle. So in v4, we start to provider hooks version. And refactor demo with hooks version first in site. You can read more with our blog:
