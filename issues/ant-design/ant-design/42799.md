# Notification global config not applied

The global config set in `ConfigProvider` is not being applied to all notifications in the app. This issue can be reproduced by setting `ConfigProvider` for the whole app, calling `notification.config()` in the same file, creating a component that uses the `notificationapi` and inserting it into the app, and calling `notification`.
Expected behavior: The global config set in `ConfigProvider` should be applied to all notifications in the app.
Actual behavior: The global config is ignored.
Environment: Ubuntu 22.04, Chrome 111, Antd 5.5.2, React 18.2.0.
Resolution: Use the static methods of `Notification` instead of the `notificationapi` to set global config.
