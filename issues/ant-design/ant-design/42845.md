The `crossOrigin` prop is not supported in `Image.PreviewGroup` or its children. This feature request is to add support for the `crossOrigin` prop in `Image.PreviewGroup` and its children. The proposed API would allow the `crossOrigin` prop to be passed to both the `Image` component and the `Image.PreviewGroup` component.
