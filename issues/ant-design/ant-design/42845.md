# Option to provide crossorigin for Image.PreviewGroup or it's children

`help wanted`,`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Although the Image component in it's self accepts the crossOrigin prop, It doesn't accept it when it is rendered as a child of Image.PreviewGroup. So the Preview components can't display images from another source

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
<Image.PreviewGroup
 preview={{ visible, onVisibleChange: (vis) => setVisible(vis) }}
crossOrigin='anonymous'
>
   <Image src={source} />
</Image.PreviewGroup>
```

or

```
<Image.PreviewGroup
 preview={{ visible, onVisibleChange: (vis) => setVisible(vis) }}
>
   <Image src={source} crossOrigin='anonymous' />
</Image.PreviewGroup>
```
