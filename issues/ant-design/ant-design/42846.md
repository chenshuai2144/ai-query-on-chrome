antd 5.5.2 version has a bug that causes the height of textarea to change to "auto" when the page width is changed. This issue can be reproduced by visiting <https://stackblitz.com/run?file=demo.tsx> and expanding the demo panel using the drag handle. The expected behavior is for the height of the textarea to remain constant even when the page width is changed.
