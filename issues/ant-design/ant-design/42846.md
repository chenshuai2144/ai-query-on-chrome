This issue appears to be related to the height of `<textarea>` elements within an Ant Design form when their width is changed dynamically. The current behavior is that the height of the `<textarea>` element automatically adjusts to fit the available space, which can cause unexpected behavior if the user has manually set a specific height for the element. To fix this issue, the `rows` prop should be used to specify the number of rows for the `<textarea>`, rather than setting the height explicitly. This will ensure that the `<textarea>` always maintains its specified height, regardless of changes to the layout of the page.
