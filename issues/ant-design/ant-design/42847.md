This feature requests the addition of keyboard events for editing an Ant Design table when there is a large amount of data. Currently, users must use a mouse to select each cell individually, which can be time-consuming. A suggested solution would be to include a switch property in the API. The Ant Design team currently does not offer an official editable table component. Users will need to implement the functionality in their own applications.
