The scroll bar style of Select component is not changing according to the height of its content in some cases. This issue is caused by the virtual scroll feature, which uses an estimated size for the scroll bar based on the total number of items rather than taking into account the actual height of each item. As a result, the scroll bar size becomes incorrect and causes scrolling problems when the height of the content exceeds the height of the container slightly. To fix this issue, you can try disabling the virtual scroll feature and use the native scroll bar instead.
