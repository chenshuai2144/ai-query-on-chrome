# Customize the Option content of Select, scroll bar style problem

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-g7nlmk?file=src%2FApp.tsx](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-g7nlmk?file=src%2FApp.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

When the height of the list content slightly exceeds the height of the box.

### What is expected?

The height of the scroll bar can be changed according to the height of the list content.

### What is actually happening?

The height of the scroll bar does not change, so when the height of the list exceeds the box slightly, scrolling will become very strange

Thanks for feedback. You can close virtual scroll which will be fallback to native scrollbar.

For virtual scroll, scrollbar size is deps on the `options.length` which not take item height into account (since other option out of screen is not real render which can not get the real height). To take all height into account will be expensive which we may not apply : )
