When trying to re-export the `MenuItem` component in TypeScript, a type error occurs because the interface of the imported component is not being exported. The error message states that an exported variable "GenericComponent" is using a name that is defined in an external module "stackblitz:/node_modules/antd/es/menu/MenuItem" but cannot be named.
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that all the necessary interfaces and components are properly exported when importing them. It's recommended to check the documentation of the library or the source code to see if there are any missing exports. Additionally, make sure that your TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) includes the correct compiler options for modules and exports.
