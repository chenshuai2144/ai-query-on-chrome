This feature solves the problem of duplicate rows in the select component when using the "key" property for both the "value" and "key" properties. The proposed API is to use the "options" property instead of the jsx structure, which is recommended in v5. This will avoid breaking changes and allow for compatibility with legacy versions of antd.
