This feature solves the problem of having to specify both the "key" and "value" properties when using the Option component with the multiple mode in Ant Design. The API proposal suggests using the "options" prop instead of JSX structure for better developer experience and recommends avoiding using the deprecated "key" property in new versions of Ant Design.
