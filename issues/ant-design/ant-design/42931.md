Ant Design Table in version 4.18.0 does not respect column width when container width is limited, causing the table to not have a fixed width. This issue was caused by the removal of the `min-width` attribute in the `ColGroup` styling in rc-table, which was removed in version 7.15.x. To fix this issue, you can set the `table-layout` prop to `fixed` to force the table to have a fixed width.
