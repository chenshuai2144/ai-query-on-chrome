# Table does not respect column width on limiting container width after upgrading from 4.10.0 to 4.18.0

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-table-4-18-0-mp5pvx?file=/src/App.js:847-903)

### Steps to reproduce

Above reproduction is based on antd 4.18.0 after upgrading from 4.10.0. Same reproduction for 4.10.0 is here: https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-table-4-10-0-cmpr22?file=/src/App.js

### What is expected?

Both have been limited by setting container max width to 400px however the earlier version respects min width because it sets a `min-width` attribute in ColGroup styling which was removed by rc-table team (https://github.com/react-component/table/pull/626) in 7.15.x release (antd 4.18.0 depends on rc-table @7.21.0)

### What is actually happening?

antd 4.18.0 table does not have respect width under large column structure or smaller render window to force per column width if set via `columns` prop. Like so:

### @4.10.0:

| Environment | Info     |
| ----------- | -------- |
| antd        | 4.18.0   |
| React       | 18.2.0   |
| System      | macOS 13 |
| Browser     | Brave    |

Any alternative approach without setting peer dependency (rc-table) under 7.15.x

PS. Upgrading to 4.10.0 fixed https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/42773

Hi bro,I think you are right.
The wrong layout is beacuse of `table-layout:'auto'`, but we need the `min-width` to limit it's width sometimes
You can temporarily fix it by `ClassName` waiting for the antd team deciding how to fix this problem

Follow @BoyYangzai 's reply. Table removed `fixed` by default. It will auto response to Table current width as native table behavior. You can force width with `tableLayout`:
