This is a memory leak issue with the Cascader component in Ant Design. It has been reported that when multiple cascading options are set and the component is destroyed, it causes a memory leak. The issue can be reproduced with versions 5.x and 4.x of Ant Design and React, but not 18.x. A possible solution could be updating the dependencies to the latest version or finding an alternative solution.
