`rev=""` sadly is the temp fix

## arturdonda

Updating `@types/react` solves the issue. More info here: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/42767#issuecomment-1595198355

Proposed alternative low-cost, low-impact solution:

Q: Why not update @types/react and @types/react-dom to the latest version (18 or above)?
A:

1. The impact scope is too broad. In my project, we use internal company components based on version 17, and there might be other dependencies in your project that are not compatible with version 18.

2.Your project might be using a version of React that is not 18, such as 17 or 16.

Approach: Add the 'rev' attribute yourself and redirect React type files.

src/@types/react/index.d.ts

```typescript
import { AllHTMLAttributes as Attributes } from "react";

export = React;
export as namespace React;

declare module "react" {
  interface AllHTMLAttributes<T> extends Attributes<T> {
    rev?: string | undefined;
  }
}
```

tsconfig.json

```diff
{
    "compilerOptions": {
          "paths": {
+	      "react": ["src/@react/index.d.ts"],
          }
    }
}
```
