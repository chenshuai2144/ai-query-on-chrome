The autofocus prop in Dropdown does not work correctly when navigating with the keyboard. It only works when clicking on the three dot icon to open the menu. This issue started occurring in version 5.5.0 and can be reproduced in the provided reproduction link. The expected behavior is that the focus should shift to the menu and allow for selecting an option using the keyboard, but instead, the focus remains on the input field.
