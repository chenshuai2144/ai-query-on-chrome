# Avatar prop "alt" doesn't work

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-fork-avatar-props-alt-pvtfsc?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

1. import Avatar component
2. Specify attribute "alt"
3. Look at DOM tree to check alternative text for avatar

### What is expected?

Alternative text in corresponding avatar node into DOM tree

### What is actually happening?

Just insert span for avatar without alternative text (no attr "alt"/no WAI-role/no aria-label)

| Environment | Info         |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| antd        | 5.6.1        |
| React       | 18.2.0       |
| System      | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Browser     | Chrome 114   |

I don't exactly know what must be rendered for a11y via "span" elements. I guess that span element should have role="img" and aria-label=alt-text. Instead of "alt-text" it needs to insert alternative text from "alt" prop

Maybe we should improve accessibility?

@Wxh16144 I've just dig into sources of Avatar component and noticed that prop "alt" works well if it passed attribute src as string. In other cases prop "alt" is not used by component. Thus, my issue might be closed if you don't think in other way

Yes. You got it. For image it should pass `alt` for a11y. For string avatar, screen reader can read text directly : )
