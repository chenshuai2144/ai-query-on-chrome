The Promise.reject() function is not working correctly in Modal onOk after a recent change. When "OK" button is pressed, the Modal remains open and shows an error instead of closing as expected. This issue can be reproduced using the provided reproduction link in the Codesandbox environment. The current behavior is different from what is expected, where the Modal should remain open but without errors.
