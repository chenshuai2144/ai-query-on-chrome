After the changes in https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/40018 the Promise.reject() doesn't work correctly for Modal Buttons

I believe your codesandbox works as expected.

1. `return Promise.reject()` means Modal won't confirm and close as a success process, it would stop loading state on Ok button.
2. codesandbox.io will catch Unhandled promise rejections and show a red box with error message. See https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-wc3t3k?file=/index.js
