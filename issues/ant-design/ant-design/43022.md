The Promise.reject() function in Modal onOk is not working correctly in certain environments. This can be reproduced by opening a Modal and clicking the OK button. The Modal should remain open and there should be an error message. This issue was introduced in a recent change and can be fixed by using a different method to prevent the Modal from closing.
