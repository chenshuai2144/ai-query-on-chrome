文本在视距外的排版异常，确实是个老问题了。

## devuxer

@afc163, Can this be fixed? Is there a workaround?

Is `max-content` style help?

## devuxer

@zombieJ , YESSS! That fixes it. Thank you!

Maybe you could make that the default?

`max-content` maybe not the best way by default. Since if content use `flex` layout of auto `wrap`. It will count wrong width. But in most case, its safe.
