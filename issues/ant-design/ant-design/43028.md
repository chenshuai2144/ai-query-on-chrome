# Not able to overwrite Next js `<Link>` color in Form element

`Next.JS`

### Reproduction link

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-2c2jq4?file=pages%2Findex.js](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-2c2jq4?file=pages%2Findex.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Use and Ant-Design `<Form>` Element and use a Next js `<Link>` Element inside it. Ant-Design will overwrite the color.

### What is expected?

Setting a text color with `className="text-red"` should change the text to red.

### What is actually happening?

The text color is overwritten by ant-design.

### Additional Infos

I used a Next js 10 Sandbox even though I'm using Next js 13 because I couldn't set up a sandbox with Next js 13. The issue is the same on both versions.

| Environment | Info    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| antd        | 5.6.1   |
| React       | Next 13 |
| System      | Mac OSX |
| Browser     | Chrome  |

Try

```diff
    <ConfigProvider
      theme={{
        token: {
          colorPrimary: '#f69620',
+         colorLink: 'inherit',
        },
      }}
    >
```

@afc163 This is not the solution it's still overwriting my `className` styles. When I add the `className` prop to it it will still not work. Outsite of the Form component it's working like charm.

I don't think it's an antd bugï¼Œ you might find the answer in NextJS document or https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues

@andybuibui Thank you for looking into this, but I can't find the answer still searching and trying but having the issue everywhere in my app. Dropdown with and `<a>` tag is also not working. `colorLink: "inherit",` is doing absolutely nothing. The font color is basic black and doesn't have a hover effect. Also no cursor pointer.
