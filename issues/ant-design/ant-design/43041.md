# Add prop to move Tree expandIcon (switcherIcon) to the right side

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Right now it's only possible to have the expandIcon (i.e. switcherIcon) on the left. I don't see a way to move this to the right, even though it's a common design use case.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Add a prop to Tree to put the expandIcon on the right side or end of the TreeNode.

This is where I want it:

It strange to move expand icon position. But you can use css to handle this:

@zombieJ This doesn't work though unfortunately, as it also moves the leaf line below it, then it looks quite strange:
