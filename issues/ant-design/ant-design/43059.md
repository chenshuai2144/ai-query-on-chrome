The `message.config` method mutates the global configuration, causing issues when using multiple messages in different containers. To avoid this, two alternative APIs are suggested: `message.config()` with a return value and `message.setup()`. The first one returns an instance of a customized message object that can be used in place of the default message, while the second one sets up the customization and returns a reference to the same message instance. It is recommended to use hooks version for more flexibility and better lifecycle management.
