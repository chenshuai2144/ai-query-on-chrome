# Alternative to `message.config` that does not mutate global configuration.

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I recently tried to use the `message.config` method to customize the container of a message:

```javascript
message.config({
  getContainer: () => container,
  ...otherConfig,
});
```

However, the `message.config` method will mutate the global configuration. So if you have a different message that needs to show outside of that container or if the container gets unmounted, then bugs will start popping up.

### What does the proposed API look like?

I propose to change the current implementation to avoid mutating the global configuration:

```javascript
import { message } from "antd";
const customMessage = message.config({
  getContainer: () => aContainer,
  ...customMessageConfig,
});
message.success("This is a default success message");
customMessage.success(
  "This is a custom success message and is mounted inside a container",
);
```

If needed, a new method can be added instead:

```javascript
import { message } from "antd";
const customMessage = message.setup({
  getContainer: () => aContainer,
  ...customMessageConfig,
});
customMessage.success(
  "This is a custom success message and is mounted inside a container",
);
```

Thx for feedback. Static method is bad practice since it will not follow React life cycle. We have no plan to extend static method.

I strongly recommend to use hooks version which satisfy your requirement: https://ant.design/components/message#components-message-demo-hooks

And here is the blog about why not recommend:
