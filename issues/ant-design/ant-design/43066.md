To solve the error "Cannot find module 'antd/es/theme'" when importing the `theme` component in Ant Design, try changing the import statement to:

```php-template
import theme from 'antd/es/theme';
```

Also, make sure you have installed the required packages by running `npm install antd` or `yarn add antd`. If you are using Create React App and want to use `antd` components dynamically, you can disable the `babel-plugin-import` plugin by adding the following line to your `.babelrc` file:

```bash
// .babelrc
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-runtime"],
    ["import"]
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify the styles for each individual component separately:

```javascript
import Button from "antd";

<Button.Button />;
```

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more information about your environment and reproduction steps.
