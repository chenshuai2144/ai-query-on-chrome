The documentation for the Customize Theme page in antd is incorrect. The code snippet should use `token.token.colorPrimary` instead of `token.colorPrimary`. This issue can be reproduced by trying to use `token.colorPrimary` in the code. The expected behavior is for the code to work, but instead, it throws an error saying that the property does not exist on the type. The error occurs in the latest version of antd (5.6.2) and React (18.2.0) on Windows 10 with Chrome browser. The correct code snippet is provided in the issue description.
