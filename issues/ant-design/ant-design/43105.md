HI bro
why you want `2023-05-1th`? what it means
DatePicker with props `picker="week"` means the nth wekk in a monthï¼Œit works correctly

hello! @BoyYangzai  
i need to show the date. 2023-06-3th into datepicker of date text.

It is necessary that the shape shown in the DatePicker is shown as 2023-06-3th. I just want to know how many weeks this month is today. Can't I just customize the text shown?
