The `colorText` and `fontSize` tokens do not work with the `Popconfirm` component. A reproduction link has been provided along with steps to reproduce and expected behavior. The issue appears to be related to the way the `Popconfirm` component inherits styles from the `Popover`. Potential solutions may include updating the `Popconfirm` component to inherit styles differently or modifying the `PopupContent` of the `Popover` component.
