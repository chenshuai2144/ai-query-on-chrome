# Radio.Group "disabled" ignored when child Radio.Button elements define their own "disabled"

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-xtpfyr?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Just create a radio group that has "disable" defined with one condition (disabled={bool1}), and child button that is disabled with a different condition (disabled={bool2}).
I'd expect the child's disabled state to be effectively disabled={bool1 || bool2}

### What is expected?

I would expect a hierarchical logic for disabled. If the group is disabled, that should override the specific logic in the individual radio buttons. The AntD documentation for Radio.Group's disable prop says "Disable all radio buttons" which seems to imply that.

### What is actually happening?

If each child button has its own "disable" defined, the group's "disable" is ignored

| Environment | Info                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| antd        | 5.3.0                  |
| React       | 18.2                   |
| System      | Windows 11 pro/VS Code |
| Browser     | Chrome                 |

I'm not sure if this is intentional behavior for AntD, but I believe the parent element (group) being disabled should override non-disabled children.

Hi. This is the default logic for `Radio.Group`, and when disabled is not set on its internal `Radio`, it will use disabled of `Radio.Group`. The `Radio` own disabled will take precedence.

@Yuiai01 is right.

I can verify that in antd version 4 this was working as explained by @eberridge in the "expected" section.

Just did the upgrade in my project a couple of weeks ago and now it works upside down with no explanation in the upgrade guide?

Please reopen this as it is a valid issue üôè

In the previous code, when the disabled of the radio itself is undefined or false, it will apply the disabled from the group. Therefore, when the group's disabled is true, the disabled of its internal radio will always be true, which leads to the internal radio not correctly applying its own disabled. This is incorrect.
