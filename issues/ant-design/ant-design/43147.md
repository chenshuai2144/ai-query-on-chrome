The issue is that when a Radio.Button inside a Radio.Group defines its own "disabled", the "disabled" property on the Radio.Group is being ignored. In other words, if a Radio.Group is disabled and any of its Radio Buttons have their own "disabled" property set, the Radio.Button's "disabled" property takes precedence over the Radio.Group's "disabled" property. This is unexpected behavior and could be improved upon.
