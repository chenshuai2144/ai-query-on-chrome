# Added a column in Table to show serial number(e.g from 1 to ...100...), when page change serial number change from past number, keep the serial number column changing (still from 1 to ...100.....)

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

This will help when the table is exported by users, and they will get the srno in respected file format(CSV, Print, PDF, JSON, etc), and it make less effort from programmer side to direct set column name in respected export functionality.

### What does the proposed API look like?

sorry i can't help.

You could add it as a column in `<Table colunms={...} />`.

{
title: "SrNo",
defaultSortOrder: "ascend",
sorter:(a, b) => a.id - b.id,
render: (id, record,srno, index) => srno.indexOf(record) + 1,
width: "20%",
},

This will render 1 to 10 in every page, i need 1 to 10 for first pageand 11 to 20 for second page and so on.
And if i add Export fucntion from my side then that library will take datasource and column , In column render will render only in the table in export.
Also Antd D is great UI library Should Add All Type of export functionality default
