# <Space /> report ref error somehow

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/space](https://ant.design/components/space)

### Steps to reproduce

`<Space.Compact>` and `<Space size='small'>` will report error react-dom.development.js:86 Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()
Interesting enough `<Space>` will **NOT** report such error, I can guess there is something wrong with styleProvider implementation

### What is expected?

not error

### What is actually happening?

error

| Environment | Info   |
| ----------- | ------ |

| React       | 18     |

Space.Compact not support `ref` currently

## GuichiZhao

I never put `ref` on `Space.Compact` nor `Space`, it just report some unrelated error on `Space.Compact`, when I switched to `Space`, the error is gone. It just happened when I upgraded antd today.

## GuichiZhao

Actually, I investigate the error this afternoon and identify that something quite unrelated can cause the error. i.e. putting a `<Dropdown />` inside the `<Space />`. My project is kind of complicated and the error seem irrelevant so I can not identify the root cause and provide a reproducible code, sorry for that
