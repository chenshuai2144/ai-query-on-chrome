# Multiple dropdown menus (with trigger=context) remain open

`🐛 Bug`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-9636ml?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

when using dropdown as right-click menu for multiple elements.
with un-controlled open status, the open status is contextual only for the single element, resulting in multiple drop-down menus open at once.

the trigger must be "contextMenu".

### What is expected?

On open of a different dropdown, all other menus should autoclose.

### What is actually happening?

multiple dropdowns remain open.

| Environment | Info               |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| antd        | 5.6.3              |
| React       | 18.x               |
| System      | windows 10         |

In antd@4.x.x the behavior was as expected.

Seems to be related with trigger update. Dropdown with legacy `rc-trigger` acts good: https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-xvwf94

应该不是同一个问题，trigger 不同
