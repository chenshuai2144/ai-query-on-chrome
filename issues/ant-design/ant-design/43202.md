When multiple dropdown menus (with trigger="context") are used as right-click menus for multiple elements, the open status remains contextual only for the single element, resulting in multiple drop-down menus being opened simultaneously. The trigger must be "contextMenu". Expected: When opening another dropdown, all other menus should automatically close. Currently, multiple menus remain open. Environment: antd@5.6.3, React@18.x, Windows 10, latest Chrome/Edge. This issue occurs in antd@4.x.x but not in the legacy version with `rc-trigger`.
