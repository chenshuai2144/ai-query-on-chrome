Ant Design's multiple dropdown menus with trigger="context" remain open when using right-click menu for multiple elements. The trigger must be "contextMenu". Expected behavior is that all other menus should autoclose when a different dropdown is opened. The issue is observed in version 5.6.3 of Ant Design and may be related to trigger update. A reproduction link is provided.
