The proposed solution is to add a callback prop to the presets prop in the Date Picker component to calculate the start and end dates based on the preset label when the option is chosen. Alternatively, the onChange handler can pass the preset label as an optional parameter to recalculate the date and time array at the point of selection. A workaround is to recalculate the presets when the user clicks the input using the onClick prop. The feature request has been released in version 5.8.0.
