Range Picker allows presets to use the current time as of user clicking the option. Currently, presets are only calculated on page load/component mount, resulting in incorrect end times if the user waits on the page for a few minutes before selecting a preset. The proposed API includes a callback prop or an optional parameter in the onChange handler to allow for recalculation of the date and time array at the point of selection. A work-around is to recalculate the presets when the user clicks the input using the onClick prop. The feature will be released in version 5.8.0.
