The issue seems to be related to the use of `ConfigProvider` in different parts of the application. When multiple `ConfigProvider`s are used, they overwrite each other, causing the error message in the form to be different from the `ConfigProvider` at `_app`. The solution would be to wrap the parts of the application where the `ConfigProvider` is needed, instead of wrapping the entire application.
