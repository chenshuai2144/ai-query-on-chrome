A bug occurs when using `ConfigProvider` with `validateMessages` in a modal. It appears to work fine when the `Form` is not in a modal. The problem occurs when there are multiple nested `ConfigProvider`s. To fix the issue, you can declare a `ConfigProvider` again internally where needed, so that the component will use the configuration from the recent `ConfigProvider`.
