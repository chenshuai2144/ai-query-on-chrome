Antd DatePicker in version 5.5.1 has an issue with the format property where selecting a date containing "WW" causes an error and reports "ISO week is not a function". To resolve this, try importing the advancedFormat and isoWeek plugins for dayjs. This can be done temporarily using the following code:

```javascript
// ...
import advancedFormat from "dayjs/plugin/advancedFormat";
import isoWeek from "dayjs/plugin/isoWeek";
dayjs.extend(isoWeek);
dayjs.extend(advancedFormat);
```

This should fix the issue, but it's worth noting that importing these plugins adds to the size of the package.
