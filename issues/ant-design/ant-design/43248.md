In antd 5.6.3, multiple column filterdropdowns can be opened at the same time, but in older versions, only one column filterdropdown was active and the previous one would be automatically closed when selecting the next column. This behavior can be replicated by visiting the reproduction link and clicking on different columns. The expected behavior is to be able to see only one column active filterdropdown.
