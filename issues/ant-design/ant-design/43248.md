In Ant Design Table component, it's possible to open multiple column filterdropdowns simultaneously in the latest version (5.6.3), but this behavior is different from the previous version (4). In the previous version, only one column filterdropdown was active and when selecting another column, the previous column filter would automatically close. However, in the current version, all columns' filterdropdowns are visible at the same time.
