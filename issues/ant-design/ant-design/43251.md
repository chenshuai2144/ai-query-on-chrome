# InputNumber onPressEnter not working properly in some environments

## Reproduction link

<https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-inputnumber-onpressenter-f3krnf?file=/index.js>

## Steps to reproduce

Run the example in any modern environment that does not support `KeyboardEvent.which` anymore.

## What is expected?

The callback provided to `onPressEnter` should be triggered in all modern environments.

## What is actually happening?

In some environments (e.g. tests running via testing-library), the callback provided to `onPressEnter` is not called. This is due to rc-input-number < 8.x using a deprecated keyboard event property ["which"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/which):

## Fix

Update rc-input-number to 8.x, which uses `key` instead of `which`.
