# InputNumber onPressEnter not working properly

`Inactive`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-inputnumber-onpressenter-f3krnf?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Run the example in any modern environment (e.g. test suites) that does not support [`KeyboardEvent.which`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/which) anymore. The value will always be `0` and the callback will not be triggered.

### What is expected?

The callback provided to `onPressEnter` should be triggered in all modern environments.

### What is actually happening?

In some environments (e.g. tests running via testing-library), the callback provided to `onPressEnter` is not called. This is due to rc-input-number < 8.x using a deprecated keyboard event property ["which"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/which):

Here is the fix:
https://github.com/react-component/input-number/commit/a225ca04e57f92fc77b7c6770cd90bcbb3813f95#diff-2b8b09f37ab696a03bb4cf168ef4f3c348a99d1f5bbb4d645f5520153d8790f8R459

| Environment | Info                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| antd        | 5.6.3                  |
| React       | 18.2.0                 |
| System      | Mac                    |
| Browser     | @testing-library/react |

The fix would be updating rc-input-number to 8.x, but the corresponding PR has been closed 2 weeks ago:

React is already handle this with [SyntheticEvent](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/events.html#keyboard-events), it's safe to use it:

Proxy code: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a1c62b8a7635c0bc51e477ba5437df9be5a9e64f/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/events/SyntheticEvent.js#L493

But I'm OK to accept PR for updating use `key` instead.

Glad to hear! Looking forward to the next antd release then! üôá

Since it's low priority task and no volunteer take this, closed.

I see, the `rc-input-number` package has been updated. So the issue is even resolved with the next release, I guess. üëç
