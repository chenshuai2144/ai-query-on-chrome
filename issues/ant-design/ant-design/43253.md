The props are typed to accept several props from the rc-color-picker but not all props are actually being relayed.

See:
https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/color-picker/ColorPicker.tsx#L29-L79

Not spreading the `...rest` props might lead to other issues as well (e.g. `data-` attributes and others not being relayed)

## RedJue

In fact, **disabledAlpha** is only implemented in rc-color-picker, not in antd. We are still discussing whether we need to expose it to users in antd.

I see. Would be a bummer for me, as I got some backends that don't support alpha values - so I would not be able to remove another library in favour of using the antd component.

Until it's decided it might be a good Idea to add it to the `Omit<RcColorPickerProps, 'onChange' | 'value' | 'defaultValue' | 'panelRender' | 'disabledAlpha' >` nonetheless.
Because right now, TypeScript would suggest it to anyone using the ColorPicker (that's how I found it).  
Still, the issue with the `data-` props (and any others that are not omitted) remains. They will be accepted but not actually relayed to the actual picker (and in the end the DOM node).
