"disabledAlpha" prop not available in ColorPicker of Ant Design v5.6.3. Feature request to include in rc-color-picker but currently only supported in rc-color-picker. Solution proposed by adding it to Omit prop type causing TypeScript errors, potential issues with data-attributes not relayed. Resolved in version 5.8.0.
