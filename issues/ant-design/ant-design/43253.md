The `disabledAlpha` prop in the `ColorPicker` component does not work as expected. It is only implemented in the `rc-color-picker` library and not in `antd`. It is recommended to add it to the `Omit<RcColorPickerProps, 'onChange' | 'value' | 'defaultValue' | 'panelRender' | 'disabledAlpha' >` prop type until a decision is made on whether to expose it to users in `antd`. However, the issue with `data-` props and others not being relayed still exists.
