antd v5.6.3 has an issue where the ellipsis flickers on initial render. To reproduce, visit the reproduction link and observe the issue. The expected behavior is for the ellipsis to not display any text on initial render, while the actual behavior is that it displays the entire text initially, then collapses. This issue occurs with React 18.2 and Ant Design 5.6.3 on Windows using Chrome. The reproduction code snippet uses the typography.Paragraph component with the expandable and rows options set to true and "More" as the symbol for the ellipsis.
