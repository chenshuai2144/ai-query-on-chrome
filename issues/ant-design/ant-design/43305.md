It seems that the issue is related to the use of `RecursivePartial` in combination with `strictNullChecks` in TypeScript. The `RecursivePartial` interface allows for the merging of two objects, but it does not handle the case where one object has a property that is `null` or `undefined` and the other object has a property with the same name but a different type. This causes a type error when trying to merge the two objects.
One solution to this issue is to use a different approach for merging objects, such as using the `Object.assign` method or the `merge` function from the `lodash` library. These methods can handle the case where one object has a property that is `null` or `undefined` and the other object has a property with the same name but a different type.
Another solution is to turn off `strictNullChecks` in TypeScript, which will allow the `RecursivePartial` interface to work as expected. However, this is not recommended as it can lead to type errors in other parts of the codebase.
