Keyboard navigation in RadioGroup does not function correctly. Reproduced using the reproduction link and following steps: 1) Select item 2 in a radio group with 3 buttons; 2) Tab out of the radio group; 3) Tab back into the radio group. Expected behavior: Focus should remain on item 2. Actual behavior: Focus moves to item 1. This issue occurs because the input elements produced by the radio button component do not have a name attribute.
