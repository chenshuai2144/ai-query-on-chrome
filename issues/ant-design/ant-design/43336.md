Looking at the code, the rc-field-form package sets the initialValues ​​type to Record<string, any>

Form with `form` prop can get generic type from `useForm` instance. But Form.Item is no related with Form. It can not get the type from runtime structure. You can not realize it in Typescript. But only add generic in each component:

```tsx
<Form.Item<FieldType> />
```
