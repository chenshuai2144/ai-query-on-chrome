Table component's filters do not close when another is opened. Reproduced in StackBlitz: [https://stackblitz.com/run?file=demo.tsx](https://stackblitz.com/run?file=demo.tsx). Expected behavior: When clicking on the second filter box, the first filter box should close. Actual behavior: Both filter boxes appear at the same time. Environment: antd 5.6.4, React 16.12.0, macOS 13.4.1, Chrome 114.0.5735.198.
