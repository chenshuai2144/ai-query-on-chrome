### Steps to reproduce

On Vercel, my next js project build has started failing suddenly since last 24 hrs with "yarn run build" cmd, however in my local the build is successful.

## Error log:

...

Detected Next.js version: 13.4.8
Running "yarn run build"
yarn run v1.22.17
$ next build

  Failed to compile.
  ./components/AvatarBox.js
  Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/Avatar'

## The component code I am using to import Avatar:

import { Avatar } from 'antd';

const AvatarBox = ({ children, size, dataItem }) => {
return (
<div className='avatar-box-container'>
<Avatar size={size} src={dataItem.profile_images[0].url} onClick={() => alert("HII")}/>
{children}
</div>
)
}

export default AvatarBox

### What is expected?

Build should get successful as it used to happen before 24 hrs.

### What is actually happening?

Build is failing showing error for all the antd components with above error

It's bug of nextjs v13.4.8, and still not fixed: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/52031
