I think this a compatibility issue with the most recent NextJS release.

If you install version 13.4.7 of next, everything works as expected, but bumping to 13.4.8 surfaces this error.

Same issue here.

This works
Thanks
But the issue still needs to be fixed though.

## seanmcquaid

Same deal for me with the newest Next 13.4.8

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/Button'
1 | import React from 'react'
> 2 | import {Button} from 'antd'
```

Same error with Nextjs@13.4.8 antd@5.6.4
And temporarily solved by downgrading Nextjs@13.4.7

Same issue.

Only happens on `next@13.4.8`, not on `next@13.4.7`.

This worked for me remove ^before 13.4.7 the version if you have.

Why was this closed? Is this truly fixed if the solution was to downgrade the package? Is this error an issue with Next or does AntD have to update their packages tp be compatible with the latest Next.js version?
