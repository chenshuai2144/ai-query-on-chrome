Ant Design and Next.js are having issues when using the ConfigProvider component together. The error message "Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/ConfigProvider'" appears when wrapping a custom component with ConfigProvider. The problem seems to be caused by a compatibility issue between the latest versions of Next.js and Ant Design. Installing version 13.4.7 of Next.js resolves the issue. However, a permanent fix is needed.
