A bug occurs when wrapping a `<Component />` with the `ConfigProvider` from `antd` in the `Next.js` environment. The error message is "Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/ConfigProvider'". This issue is caused by a compatibility issue between `Next.js` and the latest version of `antd`. To fix the issue, you can either install version 13.4.7 of `Next.js` or temporarily solve the issue by downgrading `antd` to version 5.6.4. The issue has been fixed in version 13.4.16 of `Next.js`.
