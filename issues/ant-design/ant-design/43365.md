Unable to apply `selected` class on segmented item when disabling animations. To reproduce, disable animations and highlight selected segment item. The `ant-segmented-item-selected` class should be attached to the selected element, but it disappears instead. This bug occurs in version 5.6.4 of antd with React 18 on Mac latest using Chrome latest.
Suggested solution: add `motion: false` to the theme configuration.
