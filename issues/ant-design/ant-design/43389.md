# components are too small on high dpi displays

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Does ant design use px to size components by default, it seems that components are too small on high dpi displays and too large on low dpi displays.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Use rem instead of px internally for sizing components
