Ant Design's InputNumber component does not properly scale when placed within a Column with a small or large span value. This results in the input number overlapping other components or having its default size displayed within a large column. A workaround for this issue is to use `style={{ width: '100%' }}`, but this should be addressed by Ant Design directly.
