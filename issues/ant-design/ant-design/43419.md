The Mentions component in Ant Design currently does not allow searching for options by their label and displaying the label in the text after the prefix '@'. This is a common use case and the functionality is missing. The current implementation uses the same value for both the value and label properties, which can cause issues in practice. A workaround is possible for the first issue, but not for the second. The API of Mentions is designed based on Select and other similar components in antd, so it is okay that each item should have a `value` prop.
