Mentions component currently has issues where the label is not shown in the text after the prefix '@' and searching for labels within the dropdown is not supported. This is due to the fact that the component uses the same value for both the value and label properties, which causes problems when searching for options. The API of Mentions is based on other components in antd, so it may not be feasible to change the design to display options related to the input. However, a workaround for the first issue could be implemented. The feature request is to add support for displaying options related to the input and searching for labels within the dropdown.
