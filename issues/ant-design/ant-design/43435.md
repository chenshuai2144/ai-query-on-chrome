The Input token's colorPrimary is not being merged with the global token, even though it should. This issue can be reproduced by modifying the colorPrimary in the Input token and observing that the border color remains unchanged. The expected behavior is for the Input token's colorPrimary to overwrite the global token. The problem is caused by the fact that ComponentToken only replaces `AliasToken`, which does not participate in algorithm calculation.
