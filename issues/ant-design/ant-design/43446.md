A UI bug occurs when using a nested <Descriptions> component with a bordered description, causing the inner description to have a border. This can be reproduced by adding a borderless description inside a bordered one. The expected behavior is for the inner description to be borderless, but instead, a weird UI is introduced. This issue is similar to #39183.
