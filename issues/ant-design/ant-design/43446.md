When using a nested <Descriptions> component with a bordered description, a UI bug may occur where the inner description is not borderless. This can be reproduced by creating a <Descriptions> component with a bordered description and then adding another description inside it with a borderless style. The expected behavior is for the inner description to be borderless, but instead, a weird UI is introduced. This issue is similar to #39183.
