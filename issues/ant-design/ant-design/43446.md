A UI bug occurs in Ant Design version 5.6.4 when a bordered description contains an inner non-bordered description. This issue can be replicated by nesting a bordered description within another one with `bordered={false}`, resulting in a strange UI effect. It has been observed in various environments including Ant Design, React, System, and Browser, and a fix is planned. Similar reports have been made in issues #39183 and #49146.
