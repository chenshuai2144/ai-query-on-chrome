Reproduced a bug with setting the `colorItemBgSelected` token in the `<Menu>` component of Ant Design 5.6.4, where it does not work and there is no deprecated warning message in the console. The token is still recognized in the configuration provider's theme object but does not have any effect on the selected menu item background color. Expected behavior is for the `colorItemBgSelected` token to be used to set the selected menu item background color and for a deprecated warning message to appear in the console.
