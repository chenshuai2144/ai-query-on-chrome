`colorItemBgSelected` in `<Menu>` is deprecated in `antd@5.6.4`. Reproduction link: <https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-vx2yh1-dcqzcy?file=demo.tsx>. Expected: `colorItemBgSelected` should work and there should be a deprecated warning in the console. Actually happening: `colorItemBgSelected` is not working and there is no deprecated warning in the console. Environment: antd 5.6.4, React 18.2.0, MacOS 11.7.7, Chrome 114.0.5735.198.
