Bug: The `placement` option passed to the `notification` prop in the `App` component does not work as expected. The notification popup always appears at the topRight, instead of the position specified in the `placement` prop. The issue is caused by the `Holder` component, which receives the `NotificationConfig` as props but does not take into account the `placement` field. A possible fix is to destructure the `placement` field and then, change `getStyles` to close over the `placement` field instead of passing it as an argument.
