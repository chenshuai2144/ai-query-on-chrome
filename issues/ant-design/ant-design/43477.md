Antd Table crashes when multiple filters are selected on different columns at the same time in some environments. The reproduction steps involve opening two filter windows, selecting several filters, then clicking outside the table or an "OK" button to cause the application to crash. The issue may be caused by having multiple filter windows open simultaneously, and the recommended solution is to close any other filter windows when one is open.
