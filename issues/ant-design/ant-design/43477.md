| Environment | Info                |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| antd        | 5.6.4               |
| React       | 17.0.0              | (This also happens in React 18 as shown in the reproduced code) |
| System      | Windows 10 Pro 21H2 |
| Browser     | Chrome              |

A better way to implement this and also to avoid crashing - there is no necessity to have several filter windows opened at the same time. If one popup filter window is open - the others should be closed.
