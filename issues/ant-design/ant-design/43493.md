### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-twzkpn?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open link https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-twzkpn?file=/index.js
2. Open development tools
3. Search the DOM-tree for a node with class="ant-tree-list-holder-inner"
4. Right-click on the found node => Break on => subtree modifications
5. Try to click "Remove node" button
6. Script execution should stop on the breakpoint (react-dom.development.js:11099)
7. Look at the removable node: it is shifted

### What is expected?

It's expected that removable node won't twitch

### What is actually happening?

The removable node always twitches when removing

In fact, if you don't set the breakpoint, this issue won't be noticed for such an example for some reason, but it's a really noticeable issue in our production

For prev fix, it use `useLayoutEffect` which will not show flick in view but when for a break point you will find this.
