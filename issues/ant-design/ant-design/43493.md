The issue is that when removing a node from the tree, the node being removed is shifted for a while. This is causing a flicker effect when the node is removed. The issue is more noticeable in production. The previous fix used `useLayoutEffect` which does not show the flicker in view, but when a breakpoint is set, the issue can be seen.
