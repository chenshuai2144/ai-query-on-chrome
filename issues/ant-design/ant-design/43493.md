When trying to remove a node using the "Remove Node" button in a code sandbox demo, the affected node will twitch, even without a specific code snippet to reproduce the issue. This behavior can be observed in both the reproduction link provided and the original code sandbox demo.
The issue seems to be caused by the use of the `useLayoutEffect` hook in the tree component, which updates the DOM structure after rendering has completed. When the user clicks the "Remove Node" button, the `useLayoutEffect` hook triggers another re-render, causing the affected node to twitch as it moves into its new position in the DOM tree.
To fix this issue, the use of `useLayoutEffect` could be avoided by instead using a ref to keep track of the node's current state and updating it directly when necessary.
