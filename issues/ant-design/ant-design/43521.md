# readonly mode for options in Select

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Im in admin panel and there is a user list. Im able to edit information about these users. Lets imagine the situation i want to have ability to change user roles. Im using multi-select for this what is quite convenient (tags, search).

My role as logged in user allow me to add/remove roles to other user but ADMIN. If someone is admin, i shouldn't be able to deselect this role (can select/deselect other roles but this one should be on "read-only" mode).

### What does the proposed API look like?

```Typescript
interface OptionType {
  label: ReactNode;
  value?: string | number | null;
  readonly?: boolean;
}
```
