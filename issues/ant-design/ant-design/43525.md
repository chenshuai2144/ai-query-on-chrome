I just wondering if the latest build, Antd v5.7.0 work well with Next v13.4.9? I've just upgraded both to the latest version and found out that the font family is gone. I'm not sure if this issue occurs because of Antd or Next so I tried rolling back the previous version and everything back to normal. Hope someone can help
