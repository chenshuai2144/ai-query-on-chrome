Not like Tabs, Anchor is active when referred content is in screen, which is same both horizontal and vertical.
Try to use `getCurrentAnchor` to make Anchor controlled.

@MadCcc As you said

> Anchor is active when referred content is in screen

Then see the demo, obviously `Part 1` is in screen, but `Part 1` anchor is not active.
