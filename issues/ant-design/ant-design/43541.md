There is an issue with the Tab component in Ant Design where it flickers when the content for a clicked tab is added below the previous one. This occurs because the previous node is not being deleted/hiding before the next one appears. To fix the issue, you can set the container of the Tab component to be a fixed height. However, this poses a risk as the interface will only work correctly at one resolution and within only one tab.
