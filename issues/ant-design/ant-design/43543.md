An issue with the Expandable Row Rendering when using custom expand icons in Ant Design 4.24.1 is that expand icons are displayed for every record even when the data is cleaned. This behavior can be reproduced by generating some data with children, writing a function to delete the children property for data objects that have an empty children array, calling the function to clean the raw data, and entering it in as the dataSource in a table with expandable rows. The issue can be resolved by setting the visibility of the expand icon to hidden when the employees property is empty.
