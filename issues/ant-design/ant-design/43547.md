Next.js dynamically generates font family names, which can cause issues with font styling. In the reproduction link provided, the issue occurs when upgrading AntD and Next.js to the latest versions. The input field's font-family is changed from Roboto to Times. To fix this issue, the user can update their `package.json` file to specify the font families they want to use, and then run the command `yarn upgrade-pkg` to upgrade AntD and Next.js to the latest versions. Alternatively, they can change the font family configuration in their `theme.json` file to `inherit`, so that the ConfigProvider component ignores the specified font families.
