The issue is that the radio buttons are not centered in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and unconfirmed browsers. It can be reproduced by changing the browser zoom to 80. The expected behavior is for the radio buttons to be in a normal form with the dot in the center, but instead, the dot is flattened and not centered. The issue affects antd version 4.24.12 and other versions.
