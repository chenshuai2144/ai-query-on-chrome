The issue is with the radio buttons not being centered when viewed on Internet Explorer and some other browsers at a certain zoom level (80%). The reproduction steps involve changing the browser zoom to 80, and the expected behavior is for the radio buttons to be in their normal form with the dot in the center, while the actual behavior is for the dot to be flattened and not centered. This issue is affecting all versions of Ant Design and has been reported since April 2022.
