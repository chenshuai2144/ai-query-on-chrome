# Form input rule: the required error message and the red border around the field are still visible despite the input field is no longer required

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-xlglm5?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click on the "Toggle validation" button (The note field will be set as required)
2. Click on the "Submit" button (The validation is triggered, the field border is highlighted in red and the message specified in the rule is displayed)
3. Click on the "Toggle validation" button (The required rule is removed but the error message and the red border around the filed is still visible)

### What is expected?

When the field rule changes from required to not-required, the error message and the red border should disappear immediately

### What is actually happening?

The error message under the field and the red border are still visible despite the required rule is no longer valid

In the application we are developing, a field can add or remove the required rule of another field. The user should see the change of the required state without having to submit the form.

Validation triggers when rule match `validateTrigger`. So modify `rules` will do nothing on it since it not match `validateTrigger`. You can call `validateFields` if out of the validation life cycle instead : )
