Installing Next.js and tRPC SSR can cause "useInsertionEffect" to fail due to it being client-only. To solve this, include the "use client" directive at the top of the file as advised by Next.js. If using Ant Design components in a server-rendered environment, consider removing "ssr: true" from "src/utils/api.ts". For more details, consult the documentation.
