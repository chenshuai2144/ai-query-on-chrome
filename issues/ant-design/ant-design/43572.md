There's a module not found error when trying to use the QRCode component from Ant Design in a Next.js app. The issue can be reproduced by running `npm run dev`, browsing to <http://localhost:3000>, and seeing the error message "Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/lib/qr-code'" on line 3 of the `page.tsx` file. This appears to be caused by the fact that the correct path for the QRCode component has been renamed from `qr-code` to `QrCode` in the latest version of Ant Design. It is recommended to report this issue to Next.js as well.
