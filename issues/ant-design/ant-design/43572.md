The issue is that the module "antd/lib/qr-code" cannot be found when running the Next.js app. This is likely due to a mismatch between the version of Ant Design being used and the version of the "antd/lib/qr-code" module. The solution is to update the version of Ant Design to match the version of the "antd/lib/qr-code" module.
