# InitialValues not working for nested FormItems in antd 5.7.0

When providing initialValues to a form list item or any related component, the initial values are not being displayed for nested form items. The expected behavior is to show the initial values in the form list item with nested data. The issue can be reproduced in CodeSandbox: <https://codesandbox.io/s/dynamic-form-nest-items-antd-5-7-0-forked-d5dr8z?file=/demo.tsx>. The issue is present in antd 5.7.0 and is observed in all environments including MacOS, Chrome, and React.
