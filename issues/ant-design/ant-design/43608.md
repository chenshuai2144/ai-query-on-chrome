The issue is about confusion with the types used for the `onClick` prop of a `Button`. The different types proposed (`React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>`, `React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement> & React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLAnchorElement>`, and `React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement> & React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLAnchorElement> | undefined`) make it difficult to determine which one to use. An improvement would be to simplify the type to just `React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>`.
Currently, there's no clear way to describe the event property type in this case.
It's recommended to use the simplest type possible for the `onClick` prop to avoid confusion and ensure consistency across components.
