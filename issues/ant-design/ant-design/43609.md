If you add the overflow-x: hidden, vertical scroll appears in the modal windows as well.

I'm not familiar with the logic of the getVisibleArea function, but the bug was caused by the html also setting overflow: hidden, which caused it to be omitted from the omission, thus affecting the overall logic.
If there is any other way to solve this, please advise.
