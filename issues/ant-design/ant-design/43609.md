The Overflow-x property affects the positioning of AutoComplete and Select components, causing them to appear above the visible area when the HTML element also sets overflow: hidden. This can be solved by applying the overflow-x: hidden style only to the Select or AutoComplete component itself, rather than to the entire HTML document.
