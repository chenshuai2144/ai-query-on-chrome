I have an `<Input.TextArea />` in a modal\*. the null point exception is thrown every time the modal is not open after the first mount.

\*not antd modal, but my own component that has "display:none" + [Freeze](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-freeze) when `open=false`

From the stack trace I think it's a similar issue. I think this is something that should be handled by `TextArea` itself, since it's an implementation detail.

When will this be merged into antd package? I don't see it in recent 5.7.1 and 5.7.2 versions.
