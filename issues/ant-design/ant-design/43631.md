`TextArea` breaks in Modal with Form when resetting in `afterClose` event. It can be reproduced by setting up a modal with a Form inside, adding a Form.Item with an Input.TextArea component, and using `form.resetFields()` in the `afterClose` callback to reset the form. When the modal is closed, an error will appear. This issue has been fixed in the latest version of antd.
