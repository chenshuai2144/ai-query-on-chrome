The Menu component in ant design version 5.7.0 fails to render when the secondary drop-down list is present. The error message is "ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded". This issue can be reproduced by copying the horizontal Top Navigation Menu demo of the Menu component to a local project and hovering over the drop-down submenu in Chrome browser. The expected behavior is no error to be reported, but the actual behavior is an error message "ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded". The issue can be observed in Windows 8 using Chrome browser version 114.0.5735.199 (正式版本) (64 位).
