A warning appears when using `rc-select` with a ReactNode as the label and selecting an option. This can be reproduced in the CodeSandbox link provided, and the expected behavior is that no warning should appear. The issue is caused by the label in the select options not being the same as the ReactNode passed as the label prop. This is happening in version 4.24.12 of antd and React 18.0.0 or 16.14.0. The environment includes MacOS and Chrome 102.
