A bug in the antd menu component causes the background color to disappear when the mouse hovers over a menu item. The bug is present in version 5.7.0 and has been reported by someone working on it. The reproduction link is provided. The expected behavior is for the background color to remain, but the actual behavior is for the background color to disappear. The bug is only present in horizontal menus.
