A bug in the latest version of Ant Design (5.7.1) causes the type of the parameter of the onClick event of a Button component to be inferred as 'any' instead of the expected Event type. This issue did not occur in the previous version (5.7.0). It has been reported in #43629 and is being tracked by the Ant Design team.
