A bug in TypeScript has caused the `Event` type to be inferred as `'any'` when using the `onClick` event of the `Button` component in v5.7.1 of Ant Design. This issue can be reproduced in the provided reproduction link and does not occur in v5.7.0. It was introduced in a recent release and is fixable by changing the return type of the callback function passed to `onClick`.
