`TypeScript`

### Reproduction link

[https://antd-broken-onclick--joelcampospi.repl.co/](https://antd-broken-onclick--joelcampospi.repl.co/)

### Steps to reproduce

Use the onClick event of a Button component. The type of the parameter of the onClick function is now 'any' instead of the expected Event type.

### What is expected?

To have a valid Event type for the parameter of the onClick event.

### What is actually happening?

An 'any' type is being inferred

| Environment | Info             |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| antd        | 5.7.1            |
| React       | 18.2.0           |
| System      | WSL Ubuntu 22    |
| Browser     | Firefox and Edge |

---

This didn't happened on the 5.7.0 version, so it might have broken because of some changes in the latest release (5.7.0 -> 5.7.1).
