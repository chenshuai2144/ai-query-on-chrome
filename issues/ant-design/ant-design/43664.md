The `onChange` event in the `Collapse` component currently only returns the key of the active element, making it difficult to quickly locate and scroll to it in the DOM. A proposed solution is to include an additional parameter in the `onChange` event that returns a reference to the active element. This would allow for a more flexible and convenient way to interact with the component.
