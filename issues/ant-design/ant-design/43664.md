# Pass a link to an active element in the Collapse component

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I suggest returning the link to the active element as the second parameter in the onChange event. This will allow quickly locating the element and calling scrollIntoView on it.
Without a reference to an active element, it's difficult to find it in the DOM because there are no identifiers available.

### What does the proposed API look like?

```js
onChange(key, activeElement);
```

This implementation is too piecemeal. In fact, under different requirements, developers have different requirements for the required dom elements. You can HOC of this:

@zombieJ, thank you so much! There isn't the ref property in the docs
