# formItemRender to customize Form.Item

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I wish I could have a `formItemRender` props on Form.Item to switch position of errorList and extraDom.

Our team would like to display some descriptions(which is defined as extraDom internal) above the error messages (which is defined as errorList).

If there is another way to realize it, this feature might not be required.
However It seems like `formItemRender` make us expand the ability of Form.Item.

I really hope this feature would be discussed.

### What does the proposed API look like?

create formItemRender props on Form.Item

```ts
type formItemRender = ({
  domList: {
      input: JSX.Element;
      errorList: JSX.Element | null;
      extra: JSX.Element | null;
  }
}) => React.ReactNode
```

antd wrap the Field from `rc-field-form`. So you can directly use Field component which will return what you want:
