`formItemRender` is a feature that allows developers to customize the Form.Item component by adding a `domList` prop. This prop contains an object with three properties: `input`, `errorList`, and `extra`. The `input` property is the input field itself, the `errorList` property is the error messages, and the `extra` property is any additional content that should be displayed above the error messages. The `formItemRender` prop allows developers to swap the positions of the error messages and the extra content.
