# Typing: Missing Basic Button Props

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://github.com/truemogician/ant-design-issue-reproduction](https://github.com/truemogician/ant-design-issue-reproduction)

### Steps to reproduce

Just open the project with VSCode, and the TypeScript linter will highlight the type errors.

### What is expected?

There should be no type error, as these props are valid button attributes and are included in React.

### What is actually happening?

Type error appears, saying:

```
Type '{ children: string; name: string; form: string; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ButtonProps & RefAttributes<HTMLElement>'.
  Property 'name' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ButtonProps & RefAttributes<HTMLElement>'
```

I have identified the commit that introduced the error: [4de4367](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/commit/4de43677065cd319f6eeecca3ce2545b6d727d72#diff-463cd38ab465e1f3b90463a403d8e8399f926361436eaa9adb8a76a8bf9d4140).

It appears that the intention behind this commit was to simplify the type definition of `ButtonProps`, and it seems to have no impact on the runtime behavior. Therefore, I propose a straightforward fix that simply reverts `ButtonProps` to its previous definition.
