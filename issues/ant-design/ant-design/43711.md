Ant Design's `ButtonProps` type definition is missing basic props, causing a type error in TypeScript. The error occurs when trying to use props such as `name` and `form` in a `Button`. The reproduction link is provided, and the expected behavior is for there to be no type error. The actual behavior is that a type error appears, stating that the `name` prop does not exist on the `ButtonProps` type. The issue was introduced in commit 4de4367 and can be fixed by reverting the changes made in that commit.
