Ant Design's Button component has a type error caused by missing basic props in TypeScript, which can be reproduced by opening the project in Visual Studio Code. The expected behavior is no type errors since the props are valid button attributes and included in React, but instead, a type error appears due to the missing 'name' prop in the ButtonProps definition. This was introduced in commit [4de4367](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/commit/4de43677065cd319f6eeecca3ce2545b6d727d72#diff-463cd38ab465e1f3b90463a403d8e8399f926361436eaa9adb8a76a8bf9d4140), which proposes reverting the `ButtonProps` definition to its previous state.
