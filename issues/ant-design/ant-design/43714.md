probably affected by the animation, try this

```
.ant-tabs-card > .ant-tabs-nav .ant-tabs-tab {
  transition: none;
}
```

or

```
<ConfigProvider theme={{ token: { motion: false } }}>
  <Tabs />
</ConfigProvider>
```

This help but it continue working a little strange when you have a large list of tabs. If you drag the first tab to the end, the name of the tab start to decrease it size.

## linxianxi

you can set

```
transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform && { ...transform, scaleX: 1 }),
```
