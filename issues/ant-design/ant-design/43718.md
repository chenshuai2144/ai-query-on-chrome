The `<Layout.Header />` element is not being recognized as a landmark banner in the DOM due to its placement inside a `<section />`. The expected behavior is for the `<header />` to have the `banner` role in the browser's accessibility inspector. This issue can be resolved by changing the `<Layout />` to output a `<div />` instead of a `<section />`.
