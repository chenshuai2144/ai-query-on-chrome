# Layout Header missing accessibility role

`help wanted`,`⌨️ Accessibility`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/3f96dc)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add `<Layout.Header />` inside `<Layout />`

### What is expected?

The `<header />` element in the DOM should be a landmark banner. It should have the `banner` role in the browser's accessibility inspector.

### What is actually happening?

The `<header />` is placed inside a `<section />` which nullifies its landmark status according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header#accessibility

| Environment | Info        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| antd        | 5.7.2       |
| React       | 18.2.0      |
| System      | Windows 10  |
| Browser     | Firefox 115 |

---

`<Layout />` should output a `<div />` instead of a `<section />`.
