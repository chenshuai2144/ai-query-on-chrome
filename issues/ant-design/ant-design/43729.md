Ant Design 5.7.2's Button component lacks standard HTML button attributes. This can be replicated in CodeSandbox and is caused by the absence of the "form" attribute in Button props. The expected behavior is no type error, but the actual behavior is a type error. This issue has been fixed in #43716.
