Button props missing standard HTML button attributes in Ant Design 5.7.2. This issue can be reproduced in CodeSandbox and is caused by the absence of "form" attribute in Button props. The expected behavior is not to see a type error, while the actual behavior is a type error. This issue has been fixed in #43716.
