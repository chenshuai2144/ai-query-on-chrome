### Reproduction link

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-vgdl43?file=pages%2Findex.js](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-vgdl43?file=pages%2Findex.js)

### Steps to reproduce

```tsx
<ConfigProvider
  theme={{
    components: {
      Slider: {
        railSize: 11,
        dotSize: 13,
        controlSize: 20,
        handleSize: 20,
        handleSizeHover: 16,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <Slider marks={marks} />
</ConfigProvider>
```

### What is expected?

1. The description should not overlap with the handle in the Slider.
2. Need a property that would add padding between the description and the handle.

### What is actually happening?

The description overlaps the handle in the Slider.

I tried different property configurations and even added explicit margins to the marks, but it didn't solve the problem.
