Ant Design's Slider component has an issue where the description text overlaps with the handle when certain properties such as `railSize`, `dotSize`, `controlSize`, `handleSize`, and `handleSizeHover` are set to non-zero values. The recommended solution is to add a `padding-bottom` property to the `marks` prop in the `<ConfigProvider>` component with a value of 8 pixels to prevent the description text from overlapping with the handle.
