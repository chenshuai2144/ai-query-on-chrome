Watermark's default color should be retrieved from design tokens in dark mode, but it is almost invisible now. This issue can be reproduced by switching to dark mode and observing the watermark content. Expected result: the watermark content should be visible, while the actual result is that the color of the watermark is significantly lighter and almost invisible. The environment information includes Ant Design version 5.7.2, React version 18, operating system Mac, and browser Chrome 106.
