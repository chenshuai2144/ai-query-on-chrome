This feature allows users to download images from the browser by dragging them onto the desktop or other operating system folders, without needing to use context menus or manually copying and pasting URLs. The API includes parameters for configuring whether the preview should support dragging, as well as specific options for how the dragged image is handled when dropped (e.g.,是否应该回弹到中心). This feature may be useful for scenarios where users want a more intuitive and convenient way to download images.
