The `InputNumber` component displays a floating-point number with one decimal place even though the actual value is stored as a whole number with no decimal places. This is caused by the `formatter` prop, which only replaces the output of the `InputNumber`. To fix this, use the `parser` prop to parse the input value into a whole number and then use the `formatter` prop to format the result.
