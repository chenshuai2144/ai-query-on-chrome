### What is actually happening?

By default, the picker is in an open state, so autofocus is not working while changing any date (start or end date).

I'm facing the similar issue. If i use `defaultOpen` prop then it closes the rangepicker popover on first click. When i click on input field again then range selection works fine. If i pass open prop then it only allows to select first date not the end date.

I'll try to fix this issue.

It's an issue with the rc-picker.

Since Antd has not been released yet, you can first upgrade rc-picker locally to version 3.13.0 to see the fix results.
