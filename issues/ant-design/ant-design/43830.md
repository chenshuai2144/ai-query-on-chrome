The `Statistic` component in Ant Design only allows for displaying text values within its `value` prop. To display custom HTML content within the `value` prop, users need to create a formatter function that ignores the actual value and returns the desired HTML content instead.
An example of how to do this is provided in the "What does the proposed API look like?" section, where a `Rate` component with a custom `defaultValue` prop is used within a `Statistic` component. The `formatter` function can be used to customize the display of the `Rate` component and override its default behavior.
Alternatively, if users still want to use a `ReactNode` within the `value` prop, they may need to use an alternative method, such as creating their own `Statistic` component or using other available UI components.
