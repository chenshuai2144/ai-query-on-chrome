This feature optimizes the watermark code by reducing unnecessary iterations, optimizing the re-rendering timing, and using requestAnimationFrame to ensure that the rendering is postponed until the next browser drawing frame. It also uses useCallback to cache the onMutate function instance to avoid unnecessary recreation. The performance improvement may vary depending on the scene, but it can be significant in cases with frequent DOM changes or complex watermark components.
