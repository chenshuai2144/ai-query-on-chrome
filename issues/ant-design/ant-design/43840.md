"Ant Design" does not provide an API to get the color corresponding to the status. To solve this problem, we propose to add an API such as `import { StatusColor } from antd/es/...` to get the color corresponding to the status. The current way to get the pre-defined colors of "antd" is to use the `theme` token, such as `token.blue`. There are also corresponding tokens for status colors, such as `colorError` and `colorWarning`.
