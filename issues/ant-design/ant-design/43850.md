The `PlusOutlined` icon in Ant Design (v5.7.3) appears squished in size due to a bounding box issue, where it is less wide than it is tall. The issue has been reported in the Ant Design repository and a fix is available in a pull request. To reproduce, use a minimal reproduction on codesandbox or a vector editor like Figma, or view the SVG directly. Expected is a square bounding box, but actual is less wide than tall. Environment includes Ant Design with React, and browsers such as Chrome or Firefox.
