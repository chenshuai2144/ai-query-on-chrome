# <PlusOutlined /> icon looks squished

`ðŸ’„ Design`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-plus-icon-squished-dj9hyh?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Open minimal reproduction and measure sizes of the icons. The horizontal bars are sometimes a pixel or two smaller than the vertical bar.

Alternatively, open the plus icon SVG in any vector editor (Figma, etc.) and compare the width of the horizontal bar with the height of the vertical bar.

### What is expected?

The bounding box of the square icon is a square.

### What is actually happening?

The bounding box's width is less than its height.

@MadCcc I'm mostly looking for feedback here. Is it realistic that the related PR will land in the near future? If not, we'd simply start using a custom plus-icon.
