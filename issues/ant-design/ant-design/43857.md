Using `imageRender` causes an error when clicking "Zoom In" or "Zoom Out". The error is caused by trying to access the `width` property of `undefined`. This error can be fixed by calling `React.cloneElement(originalNode, { ...other })` instead of passing the original node directly to `imageRender`.
