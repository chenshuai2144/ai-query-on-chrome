# [Question] How to not clear the tree-select dropdown

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I am using the tree-select with Multiple selection
After searching in the input field and selecting an option, Is it possible to keep the dropdown view as is (without reset), but only clear the text that was searched in the input

I tried `autoClearSearchValue={false}` and `searchValue={inputSearchText}` and trying to clear the only the inputSearchText

Thanks!

Not supported, search value is controlled for filtering.
But you can customize dropdown with `dropdownRender`.

Hi @MadCcc
Is it possible to do with it `dropdownRender` ?

I mean you could manage your own `searchValue` that will not be cleared, and filter `treeData` on your own.
