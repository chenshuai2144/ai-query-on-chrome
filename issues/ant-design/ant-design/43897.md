Dark theme not working in Next.js app due to issue with `ConfigProvider`. Reproduction link: <https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/eager-snowflake-rxf5jg?file=%2Fapp%2Flayout.tsx%3A1%2C1>. Steps to reproduce: Set dark theme as default. Expected: Whole app to use dark theme. Actually happening: It is using default algorithm. Environment: Mac, Chrome.
