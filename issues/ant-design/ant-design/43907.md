antd 5.7.3 has a bug with the TimePicker component where setting the value to `dayjs("10:20:01", "mm:ss")` displays `10:20` instead of `20:01`. This is caused by the wrong parse format used in the `format` prop. The correct format should be `HH:mm:ss`. To reproduce, set the value to `dayjs("10:20:01", "mm:ss")`, render the TimePicker component with the `format` prop set to `"mm:ss"`, and expect to see `20:01` instead of `10:20`. This bug affects antd 5.7.3 and occurs in macOS with Chrome 114.0.5735.248.
