# TimePicker format bug in antd 5.7.3

When setting the value to `dayjs("10:20:01", "mm:ss")`, the TimePicker displays `10:20` instead of `20:01`. This is caused by the wrong parse format used in the `format` prop of the TimePicker component. The correct format should be `HH:mm:ss`.

Reproduction link: <https://codesandbox.io/s/shou-kong-zu-jian-antd-5-7-3-forked-t3344p?file=/demo.tsx>

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set the value to `dayjs("10:20:01", "mm:ss")`.
2. Render the TimePicker component with the `format` prop set to `"mm:ss"`.

What is expected: The TimePicker should display `20:01`.

What is actually happening: The TimePicker displays `10:20`.
