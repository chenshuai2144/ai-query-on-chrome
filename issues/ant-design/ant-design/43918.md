The `tree-table` component's rendering in RTL mode is broken, and an icon is misplaced and child elements are indented incorrectly. This issue occurs when using the `ConfigProvider` with `direction="rtl"`, adding a `table` component, and specifying a `dataSource` with a `children` property. Expected behavior is for the expand icon to be in the correct position, with child elements indented correctly. This bug affects versions 5.7.3 and higher of Ant Design and React 18 on Windows Chrome.
