# Make Steps slide

`improvement`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I have horizontal steps that when it reaches a certain number it gets crunched together and it doesn't look good, besides that, the the information gets cut short.

It would be really nice if it would slide [just like Tabs does](https://ant.design/components/tabs#components-tabs-demo-slide)

### What does the proposed API look like?

{
slide?: boolean // true by default
}

By setting the width of container, you can get what you expected. But it will not be responsive

## MadCcc

Try adding `width: max-content` to Steps and make container `overflow: auto`?

Worked perfectly. Thank you

## hbatalhaStch

@MadCcc What about making this the default behavior?

In most cases they don't want a scroll container to hide options.
