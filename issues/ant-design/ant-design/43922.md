Problem: Horizontal steps can look bad and the information is cut off when there are too many.
Proposed Solution: Add a `slide` prop to Steps to allow them to slide instead of getting cramped together. The default value should be `true`.
API:

```css
<Steps slide={false}>
  {/* ... */}
</Steps>
```

Solution: Adding `width: max-content` to Steps and making the container `overflow: auto` can help address the issue.
Discussion: Some suggested using a fixed-width container for Steps, while others recommended making it responsive. One user found that adding `width: max-content` and `overflow: auto` worked well. Another suggested making this the default behavior, but some users noted that in some cases, a scrollable container may not be desired.
