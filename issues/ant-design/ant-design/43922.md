This feature request is for a horizontal Steps component that can slide to display more information when it reaches a certain number of steps. The proposed API includes a `slide` prop with a default value of `true`. The solution suggested by @MadCcc is to add the `width: max-content` and `overflow: auto` props to the Steps and container, respectively. This worked for @hbatalhaStch, but @afc163 notes that in most cases, users don't want a scroll container to hide options.
