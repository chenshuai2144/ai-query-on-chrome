This proposal allows passing full object values to `Select` options, allowing for customization of tag rendering or option rendering. The API would include an array of objects with both `label` and `value` properties, along with any additional custom properties needed. The `tagRender` prop takes in a function that receives an object containing all available options properties as its argument, allowing for full control over how each option is displayed.
