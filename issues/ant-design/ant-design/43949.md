The UI of the ant-design website is breaking and it is not working as expected. The issue can be reproduced by heading over to <https://ant.design/> and observing the navbar breaking on every page. Additionally, when navigating to components such as the form component, the icon is not allowing clicks and the website hangs. The issue is observed on a Mac using Google Chrome with the versions of antd, React, and System as 5.8.0, 18.2.0, and mac, respectively.
