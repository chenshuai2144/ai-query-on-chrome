The `FormItemProps.children` prop is expected to be of type `React.ReactNode | (form: FormInstance<Values>) => React.ReactNode`, but it is currently of type `React.ReactNode | (form: FormInstance) => React.ReactNode`. This is because the `children` prop is being passed to the `Form.Item` component, which is expecting a function that takes a `FormInstance` as an argument. However, the `FormInstance` type being passed is not the expected `FormInstance<Values>` type. To fix this issue, the `children` prop should be passed as a function that takes a `FormInstance<Values>` as an argument.
