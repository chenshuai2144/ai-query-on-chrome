The top property of the notification component in version 5.x is not working as expected. Clicking on "200" or "500" displays the value at the top of the notification, but it appears after the value displayed by the first click on "200". This is caused by the design of the top property in version 5.x, which is now determined by the first element in the notification container instead of being set dynamically. To resolve this issue, use the useNotification hook instead of the Notification static method to customize the notification configuration.
