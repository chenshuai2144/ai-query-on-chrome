The issue is that the `form.validateFields` method is throwing an error without any error in the fields, even though the `errorFields` array is empty. This is by design, as the walking validation will be marked as failed in case the value changes during the validation. To handle this, developers should follow the React life cycle and filter out the empty `errorFields` array.
