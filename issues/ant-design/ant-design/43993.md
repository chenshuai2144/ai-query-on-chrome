Addon font size should be 16 when control size is large. The current inconsistent font size between components and text-based addons is fixed by setting `font-size: 16px` for `.ant-input-group-addon` when control size is large (e.g., `.ant-input-group-wrapper-lg`). This improvement aligns with the design language of Ant Design and enhances the user experience. Pull requests are encouraged.
