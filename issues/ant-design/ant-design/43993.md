`improvement`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Inconsistency between using text or component for addon, as component will inherit the size set in the Form, causing it to show fontSize 16, whereas addon text stays at 14

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
.ant-input-group-wrapper-lg .ant-input-group-addon {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.ant-input-number-lg   .ant-input-number-group-addon {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
