rc-field-form@1.36.2 introduces a type-check that prevents Form.Item from accepting a string as its `name` prop when styled using emotion/styled, resulting in a TypeScript error. This bug can be resolved by importing Form.Field as a generic type and explicitly specifying the type of the `name` prop in the styled function.
