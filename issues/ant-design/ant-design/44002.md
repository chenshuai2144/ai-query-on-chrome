When using the `transform` property to change the size of a modal, the modal will be initially displayed at its original size before transitioning to the new size. This behavior is due to the use of an animation, which is set up to transition from the original size to the new size over a period of time. The `transform` property is used to define the scale of the modal during the animation, with a value of `0.8` being used in the example provided. When the modal is opened, it will be displayed at its original size for one second before transitioning to the new size.
