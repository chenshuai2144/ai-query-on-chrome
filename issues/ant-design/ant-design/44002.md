When you set the `transform: scale(0.8)` property on the modal component in Ant Design, it applies an animation that scales the modal down to 80% of its original size before scaling it back up to its original size. This means that the modal is initially displayed at its full size before scaling down, then scaled back up to its full size once the animation has completed.
However, if you set the `transform: scale(0.5)` property instead, the animation will not apply until the modal is fully visible on the screen. This is because the animation starts when the modal reaches a certain size threshold, which is determined by the `trigger` prop in the Ant Design Modal component.
To fix this issue, you can override the default animation behavior by defining your own `transitionName` prop and specifying a custom animation duration using the `animationDuration` prop. For example:

```css
.purchase-order-form-modal-container {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}
```

By doing so, the modal will scale down to its final size immediately when it is rendered, without waiting for the animation to complete. However, keep in mind that this may cause some visual artifacts or flickering effects if the modal content does not match the initial size of the modal. To avoid this, you may need to adjust the `align` and `content` props in the Modal component to ensure that the modal content is aligned correctly and fits within the modal container.
