# When changing the modal antd's style, changing the transform scale(0.8) when the modal is set to open, it will be the original size for one second then only the size of the modal will be transform? Why is it? Why it is not transform during the start?

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-4t72k6?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Click open the modal

### What is expected?

The transform origin should be applied before the modal is open, in other word is that the size of modal should be already transformed before the modal is shown to the user

### What is actually happening?

When changing the modal antd's style, changing the transform scale(0.8) when the modal is set to open, it will be the original size for one second then only the size of the modal will be transform? Why is it? Why it is not transform during the start?

## MadCcc

Because the animation is fixed from `scale(0.8)` to `scale(1)`

## MadCcc

What do you expected exactly with setting `transform: scale(0.5)`?

## MarcusCody

It is the same, the animation is still there to scale from 1 to 0.5. Is there a way I can solve this issue?

## zombieJ

Modal use animation which use the `transform` css. You can override the animation with `transitionName` prop.

here: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/4476c9041b4f147d1401f996ac78d2b6befe1007/components/modal/Modal.tsx#L123

## MarcusCody

Alright weird as this one is not shown in the antd official documentation. I am able to solve the issue by changing the transitionName to my own defined className in CSS.

## MarcusCody

There's an issue after setting the transitionName with the class below, when I close the modal, the modal will not be closed, only the modal mask will be closed
`.purchase-order-form-modal-container {
  transition: none !important;
}`

## zombieJ

custom `transitionName` should provides `appear` `enter` `leave` 3 phase motion. It will not do leave motion if `leave` phase motion not set.

## zombieJ

PS: `transitionName` is internal API which is design only for special case since we still wish developer follow the Ant Design's design pattern : )

May I know where can I grab detailed information on this three-phase motion and how can i change them accordingly?

## MadCcc

Since it becomes a problem with usage, I'm going to closing it.
Feel free to open new issue if encounter with other problems.

## MarcusCody

It is weird that I have a modal with my own defined transitionName that will be able to close the modal along with its mask, but I have another similar modal on another page, it will not close the modal but it will just close its masking. I am using the same transition className for both of these modals, one works but another won't work.

This is the class name I used for both modals.
`.purchase-order-form-modal-container {
  transition: none !important;
  animation-duration: 0s !important;
}`

Even I try to use the transitionName set to transitionName = "test" it is still not working properly, the modal will not close after giving it the transitionName props

I am having a similar issue https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/29626, I tried using the transitionName = 'ant-move-down' but I do not want the transition effect
