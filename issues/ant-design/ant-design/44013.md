This feature request is for the CustomFormItem component in Ant Design 4.x, which requires the `disabled` prop of the Form instance to be able to render correctly. The issue is that the value of the `disabled` prop is not being propagated to the CustomFormItem component, and there is no way to read the status of this value. The proposed solution is to expose the `disabled` value through a hook or some other way, which would allow the CustomFormItem component to render accordingly.
