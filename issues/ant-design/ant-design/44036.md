When using the Upload component in conjunction with Form and its `normalize` and `getValueProps` APIs, unexpected behavior occurs. The Upload component's state remains unchanged and shows a loading indicator indefinitely after selecting a file. To resolve this issue, pass the file list as an object directly to the Upload component instead of using `normalize` and `getValueProps` with `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`.
