The issue is that the `valuePropName` prop is not set correctly in the `Form.Item` component, causing the `getValueProps` function to return an object with the `fileList` key as an empty array instead of the expected object with the `fileList` key as a valid file list. This can be fixed by setting the `valuePropName` prop to `"fileList"` in the `Form.Item` component.
