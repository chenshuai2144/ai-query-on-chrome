# Include the 59th minute (last minute of a given time) on `TimePicker` list

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Hello! When using `TimePicker` component with a `minuteStep` different from 1 the list of minutes includes only multiples of the given step (i.g. using the `minuteStep` as 5 the component will have minutes from 0 to 55). This can be a problem for an end user who wants to select the last minute of a given hour (the 59th minute) since this value will not appear on the list, and having an open field doesn't help.

It would be good to have a boolean property like `includeLastMinute` to have this value on the list.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Having a boolean property like `includeLastMinute` to include the last minute from an hour (59th minute) would solve the problem

```javascript
<TimePicker
  minuteStep={5}
  format={"HH:mm"}
  direction="ltr"
  placeholder={"Start time"}
  includeLastMinute
/>
```
