`TimePicker` in Ant Design has a limitation that it only shows minutes in multiples of the `minuteStep`, which may cause problems when trying to select the last minute of an hour. To solve this issue, we propose adding a `includeLastMinute` boolean prop to the `TimePicker` component, which will allow including the 59th minute in the list of options. The API for this new prop would look like: `<TimePicker ... includeLastMinute />`.
