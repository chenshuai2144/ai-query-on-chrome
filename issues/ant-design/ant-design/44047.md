I can turn of these error messages by setting `skipLibCheck` to `true`. But I'm not sure if it's the correct way or not.

Main reason behind this: we are trying to import React in a `js`/`ts` file. But we need to import them on `jsX`/`tsX` file. AFAIK.

Setting `skipLibCheck` to `true` is okay.

rm `yarn.lock` and upgrade packages. Your `@types/react` is OOD.
