The issue is caused by an outdated version of `@types/react`, which is causing TypeScript to throw an error. To fix it, try removing the `yarn.lock` file and reinstalling all the packages with `yarn`. If that doesn't work, you may need to update the `@types/react` package manually or seek help from its maintainers.
