This feature proposal aims to add a new prop, `rows`, to the `onResize` callback of the `Input.Textarea` component in Ant Design. This will enable developers to dynamically adjust the layout and styling of other components based on the number of rows in the textarea. The updated API signature would look like:

```jsx
onResize: function({ width, height, rows })
```

An example demonstrates how to use the new API in conjunction with the `useState` hook in React to adjust the layout based on the number of rows in the textarea. The updated code now takes into account the height as well as the number of rows in the textarea to provide more flexibility in layout and styling adjustments.
