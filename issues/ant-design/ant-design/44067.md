`tagRender` ?

## AsuraKev

The props for tag render only supports label and value. I cannot access other object properties to build my custom tag. e.g if my option is like

{
label: <>hi</>
value: "the value",
name: "first name",
lastName: "last name"
}

I want to be able to render my tag using the name and lastName and this is not achievable.

Can you use the full options to find?

```
tagRender={({ value }) => {
  const option = options.find(i => i.value === value);
  console.log(options.name, option.lastName)
}}

```

that sounds like a good working solution. It would be good if we can directly access the full object as props :) happy to close. thanks
