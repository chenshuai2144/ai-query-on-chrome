Antd Multi select tag does not support custom rendering of the tag. To render a custom tag, you can use the `tagRender` prop to specify a function that takes an object with `value` and `label` properties as input and returns the HTML for the tag. However, the `tagRender` prop only supports rendering based on the `label` and `value` properties, and does not allow access to other object properties.
