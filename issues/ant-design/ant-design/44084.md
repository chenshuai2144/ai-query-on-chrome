The "dynamic wave effects" feature cannot be disabled using the `token.motion` property in Ant Design. The transition duration attributes in the "wave" component are hardcoded and cannot be customized based on different `token.motion` values. To disable the dynamic wave effects, you can use the `ConfigProvider` component to override the default properties.
