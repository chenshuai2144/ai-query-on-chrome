Ok, Now i am elobarating more about this, Exactly i need an customize cards grid means as i mentioned in codesandbox below Antd Tabs those are customized cards, actually i need multiple cards and those cards will contain different apis which will be requested on clicking as tabs works with different content.

Here is what is actually needs : [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-usage-antd-5-8-2-forked-tk9zc6?file=/index.css)
i need these as **TABS** but its should be customized
_In This CodeSandBox there will be some css issue ignore and view in full screen **Open in New Window** to get better understanding of what i am actually needed and elaborating about_

I hope **Antd Team** will help me.

Just customize a component which follow the API as Tabs if you want the similar API. Since this is not antd issue, let me move into Discussion instead.
