A bug in Ant Design's nested tables occurs where the previous dropdown does not dismiss quickly when triggering a new dropdown with a click event. The issue can be reproduced in CodeSandbox and occurs when setting the trigger to "click" for a column containing a dropdown. The expected behavior is for the previous dropdown to dismiss quickly, but instead, it remains visible for a second before disappearing. The problem can be resolved by wrapping the table with the `ConfigProvider` component and disabling motion using the `motion: false` option.
