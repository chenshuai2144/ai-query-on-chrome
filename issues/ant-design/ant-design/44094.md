# Select dropdown with scroll bar triggers page scroll

When creating a Select dropdown with a scroll bar, the page scrolls when the user scrolls past the bottom of the dropdown. This is a native behavior of the browser. To prevent the page from scrolling, you can use the `getPopupContainer` prop to specify an element that has a `position: relative` style.
