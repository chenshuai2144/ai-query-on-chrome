`getPopupContainer` couldn't make body unscrollable.
It's native behavior of browser that if current element is scroll to the bottom, body will continue to scroll.

## AsuraKev

hmm, in react-select theres a prop which when specified any scrolling past the bottom will not trigger body to scroll tho.
