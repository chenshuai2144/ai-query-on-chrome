Adding `transitionName` prop to modal in Ant Design causes issues where it does not close properly. The problem seems to occur when using custom transitions and appears to affect only certain modals on specific pages. To fix the issue, you can try disabling motion by using ConfigProvider and setting `motion={false}`.
