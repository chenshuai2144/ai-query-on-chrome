It's the scroll animation of virtual list. Seems it won't be turned off by `motion: false`, but you can add `virtual={false}` to Select to disable virtual list

thanks, I would still need to virtual list feature tho for performance. Its not a deal breaker, but it would be great to rid of the flickering :)

Currently it use raf to force align to the position. It may flick when option height not ready. It's a bug.

Could I debounce function scrollIntoView to solve this problem? where multiple calls to scroll for a short period of time only take the last one.

这个问题定位到rc-virtual-list， https://github.com/bbb169/virtual-list/blob/166aba7887ab21cc0db05e3eaed07f6fc14d5dec/src/List.tsx#L214，这行代码导致虚拟列表初始化时scrollheight发生变化，从而产生了抖动。
