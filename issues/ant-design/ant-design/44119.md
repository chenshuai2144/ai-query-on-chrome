Ant Design's latest version has a regression in behavior where the popover closes when a user interacts with components within it, such as clicking on a modal. This behavior conflicts with previous versions, where the popover would remain open even when interacting with components inside it. A reproduction link and steps to reproduce are provided. The regression is impacting the user experience and needs to be addressed to maintain consistent functionality between different versions of Ant Design. The issue has been labeled "bug" and is assigned to the appropriate team for investigation and potential resolution.
