This feature request is for the `<Input />` component to treat `addonBefore` and `addonAfter` as labels for the `<input />` tag. Currently, the resulting HTML does not treat the text as labels. The proposed solution is to either wrap the `<input />` and the contents of `addonBefore` and `addonAfter` into `<label>` tags or attach them to the `<input />` tag via the `id` and `for` attributes. No new API is required.
