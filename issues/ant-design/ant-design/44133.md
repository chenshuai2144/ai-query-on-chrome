This feature request is to make the addonBefore/addonAfter elements treated as labels for the input element when using the <Input /> component. The current behavior is that they are not wrapped in <label> tags. The proposed solution would be to either wrap the <input /> and addon elements into <label> tags or attach them to the <input /> element via the id and for attributes. A new API is not required.
