An issue with the `maxCount` prop in the Ant Design `Message` component occurs when switching between tabs. After a certain amount of time, the `maxCount` can suddenly fail, resulting in multiple messages being displayed even if they exceed the defined maximum count. This issue has been observed in both Ant Design versions 5.8.2 and 4.24.13. A black animation occurs during the message disappearance phase when switching out, causing messages to accumulate. Upon returning to the page, the animation is triggered abruptly, making it appear that the maximum limit has been exceeded. This behavior is due to the current design of message stacking and notifications, but it will be addressed in an upcoming redesign.
