The DatePicker component in a custom panel render in a modal loses its styling. This issue can be reproduced in the provided CodeSandbox link. The expected behavior is for the DatePicker to look exactly like the original even when rendered in a modal. The current behavior is that the DatePicker loses all its styling. This issue has been reported in version 5.8.2 of Ant Design.
