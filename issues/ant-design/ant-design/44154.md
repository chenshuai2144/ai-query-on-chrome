It looks like the DatePicker inside Modal has no style applied.

Can we have a example of proper usage to render all types of datepickers in a custom panel render like in a modal? This panel render could be used as a responsive design for datepicker. thanks a lot

There is an example in ColorPicker: https://ant.design/components/color-picker#components-color-picker-demo-panel-render

## AsuraKev

thanks for that, but looks like the panelRender method has a different arguments ..

## MadCcc

It's because dom structure was not as expected, so css selectors do not work now.

## MadCcc

Not expected usage, closing.

## AsuraKev

Will this be a feature request?
