# Multiple Select search filter using label prop instead of value

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Using multiple select, when I try to search/filter data typing something related to `label` the dropdown list is empty because select is filtering data from `value` prop.

Let's supose I have the following data to select:

```
const dataToSelect = [{
  id: '123',
  title: 'Item 1 title',
  ... some other props
}, {
  id: '321',
  title: 'Item 2 title',
  ... some other props
},
... rest]

const options: SelectProps['options'] = dataToSelect.map(({
  id,
  title
}) => ({
  value: id,
  label: title
}))

....
<Select
  mode="multiple"
  allowClear
  placeholder="Please select"
  defaultValue={['123', '321']}
  options={options}
/>
```

In this case, when searching for 'item 2 title' (`label` prop) inside select text field nothing hapens and no option is displayed but if I search for '321' wich is the ID (`value` prop) of `item 2` the option appears but the problem is: No user knows what is the ID of options. Users know what is the title, description, etc... and that should be the filter param.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Instead of filter by `value` it should filter by `label` or perhaps add a `filter` prop...

```
const options: SelectProps['options'] = dataToSelect.map(({
  id,
  title,
  description
}) => ({
  value: id, // the value to be returned when select this option
  label: title, // the value to be displayed to user
  filter: `${title}_${description}` or [title, description] // prop to filter based on user search
}))
```

Use `optionFilterProp` to set the filter prop. `label` support ReactNode which may not always `string` type, so it use `value` by default.
