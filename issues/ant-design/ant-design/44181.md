The multiple select search filter feature solves the problem where searching for a label in the dropdown list returns an empty result when using the `value` prop. The proposed API replaces filtering by `value` with filtering by `label`, and includes a new `filter` prop for advanced filtering. This allows users to filter options based on their descriptions or any other relevant information. The `optionFilterProp` prop can be used to specify the property to use for filtering.
