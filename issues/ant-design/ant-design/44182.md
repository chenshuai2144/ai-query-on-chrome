# Children of the space component cannot have the space classnames

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-usage-antd-5-8-2-forked-c3sxfh)

### Steps to reproduce

Although I was unable to replicate the issue in my project, it still seems to be occurring.

### What is expected?

For the children components of Space, such as input and button, it is necessary to assign classnames like "ant-input-compact-item" and "ant-input-compact-first-item".

### What is actually happening?

The child components of Space behave as if they are not inside Space, therefore they are unable to obtain the classnames.

| Environment | Info                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| antd        | 5.8.3                             |
| React       | 18.2.0                            |
| System      | Windows 11 10.0.22621 Build 22621 |
| Browser     | Chrome 115.0.5790.171             |

---

In order to resolve the issue, I could import antd components like Input and Button directly into the same file and utilize them. However, my requirement is to use them in separate files.

https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/8368458bf77f5cf8170ddf95167b07776ef79419/components/space/Compact.tsx#L27C6-L27C6

I have observed that in this particular file, whenever an error occurs, the compactItemContext variable is assigned a null value. This leads to the code generating an empty string for the classNames.

Your reproduce seems work as expect. Please update reproduce for this.

In my guess, it's related your bundled multiple version of antd which can not consume same context.

I have updated the reproduction link. The issue about importing components from different paths. I resolved this by changing all the links from "antd".

You should import components from the same dir.
