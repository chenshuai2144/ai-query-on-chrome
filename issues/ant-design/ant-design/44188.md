# How to change "Menu" background color for dark theme?

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Hello,
I want to use Ant Design dark theme. On the "index.js" page, I set the "theme" settings for the "ConfigProvider" and chose "theme.darkAlgorithm" as the "algorithm". I also set "colorBgHeader" for "Layout" component. But I couldn't set the background color of "Menu" component from "ConfigProvider" -> "theme" setting.
How can I do it?

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
 <ConfigProvider theme={{
    algorithm: theme.darkAlgorithm,
    components: {
      Layout: {
        colorBgHeader: "rgb(20, 20, 20)",
      }
    }
  }}>
    <App />
  </ConfigProvider>
```

Use `darkItemBg` for Menu. Ref: https://ant.design/components/menu#design-token
