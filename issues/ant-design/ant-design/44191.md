A TypeError occurs when using the `CreateCache` from `@ant-design/cssinjs` and `<Link>` from `next.js` 13 in the `<Menu.Item>` component of `antd` in a Next.js app with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, and the `antd` and `@ant-design/cssinjs` packages installed. The error message "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)" is displayed in the browser console. The expected behavior is for the page to be routed from the "HomePage" to the "AboutPage", but an error message is thrown instead. The solution is to move the code in-between `<Layout>` from `src/app/layout.tsx` to a newly created file in `src/app/template.tsx`.
