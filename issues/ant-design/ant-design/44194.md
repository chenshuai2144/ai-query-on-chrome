# Carousel in Ant Design wrapper does not respect `useTransform` prop

When `useTransform` is set to `false`, the Slick carousel should avoid using the `transform` CSS property in its styles. This is not working correctly for the Ant Design wrapper.
Reproduction:

- Set `useTransform` to `false`
- Observe that the carousel still uses `transform` CSS property
  Expected behavior:
  The `useTransform` prop should be respected and carousel should not use `transform` when `useTransform` is `false`.
  Actual behavior:
  `useTransform` prop is being passed to the Slick carousel but Ant Design wrapper does not respect this setting and continues to use `transform` CSS property in its styles.
  Environment:
  |Environment|Info|
  |---|---|
  |antd|5.8.3|
  |React|18|
  |System|All|
  |Browser|All|
  Screenshots:
- UseTransform=true - A screenshot showing that the carousel is using `transform` CSS property.
- UseTransform=false - A screenshot showing that the carousel is still using `transform` CSS property despite the setting being `false`.
