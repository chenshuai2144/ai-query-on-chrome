Ant Design Carousel does not respect the `useTransform` prop, which is intended to restrict the usage of the `transform` CSS property when `useTransform` is false. This prop is needed in edge cases where developers want to have fixed-position children in the carousel, but there is a bug in CSS that messes up fixed position if any parent has a transform property. Slick carousel respects this prop and gives developers control over when to use the `transform` property, but Ant Design wrapper does not.
