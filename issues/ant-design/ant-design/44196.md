### Steps to reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:

Observe the tooltip at the bottom-right corner of the viewport with a lengthy title.
Notice that the tooltip title content exceeds the viewport height.
Attempt to scroll within the tooltip content to view its entire content.

### What is actually happening?
