A tooltip in an Ant Design application is not behaving correctly when the title content extends beyond the viewport height. The scroll mechanism breaks, making it difficult to view the entire content. This issue can be reproduced by loading the provided React application and observing the tooltip at the bottom-right corner of the viewport with a lengthy title. The expected behavior is for the scrollbar to act correctly, but instead, the tooltip's content extends beyond the height of the viewport, causing the scroll mechanism to break. The issue has been fixed in a codesandbox link provided by @zombieJ.
