There is an issue with the tooltip behavior when the title content extends beyond the viewport height on certain environments. The reproduction link and steps to reproduce are provided in the original post. The bug seems to be related to the tooltip's content exceeding the height of the viewport, causing the scroll mechanism to break. A fix has been proposed in another comment.
