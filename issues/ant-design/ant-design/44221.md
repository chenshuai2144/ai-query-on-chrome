Ant Design's Submenu has an issue where the animation flickers when expanding and closing the parent menu containing the expanded child menu. This can be reproduced by following these steps:

1. Expand the nested child menu.
2. Close the parent menu containing the expanded child menu.
3. Expand the parent menu.
4. The child menu animation will flicker.

The expected behavior is for the animation to be smooth, but what actually happens is that it flickers. This issue occurs in Ant Design version 5.8.3 using React version 18.2.0 on Web browser Google Chrome.
