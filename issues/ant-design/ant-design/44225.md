# [App component]: Should support configure to disable hashId

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Avoid overriding and conflict with other styles if users develop their own components.

Before:
`<div class="css-dev-only-do-not-override-b5kdff ant-app">...</div>`

After:
`<div class="ant-app">...</div>`

### What does the proposed API look like?

`<App hashPriority={false} />` `// remove hashId classname`

ConfigProvider has the ability: `theme.hashed`

## camcam2605

@zombieJ does the documentation mention this config? I can't see it in the official documentation. It still conflict with the `:hover` CSS pseudo-class
