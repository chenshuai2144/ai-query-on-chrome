The issue seems to be related to the combination of the `font-size` and `height` props on the `Tree` component. When the `font-size` is set, the `Tree` component will adjust its height to accommodate the text, which can cause the last node to be partially hidden when the `virtual-list` is activated. To fix this issue, you can either remove the `font-size` prop or adjust the `height` prop to a value that allows for the full display of all nodes.
