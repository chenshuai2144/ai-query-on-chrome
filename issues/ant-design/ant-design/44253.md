The AntD Theme Editor crashes when editing boxShadow properties in the Map Token dropdown. The environment includes AntD version and React version as undefined, operating system as Windows 11, and browser as Chrome 115. A reproduction link has been provided, along with a screen recording. Expected behavior is that users should be able to customize boxShadow, but what actually happens is that the page crashes after typing in the input field.
