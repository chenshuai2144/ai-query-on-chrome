The AntD Theme Editor crashes when editing boxShadow properties in the Map Token dropdown. The bug can be reproduced by following these steps:

1. Go to the AntD Theme Editor at <https://ant.design/theme-editor>
2. Scroll down to edit the boxShadow properties for your theme
3. Open the Map Token dropdown and edit the properties
4. Start typing in the input field, and the page will crash (a white page will be seen)

The expected behavior is that the user should be able to edit the boxShadow properties and customize them as needed. However, the actual behavior is that the page crashes as soon as the user starts typing in the input field. This issue has been reported and can be reproduced using the provided screen recording.
