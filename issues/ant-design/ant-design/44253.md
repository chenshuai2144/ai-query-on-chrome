I've prepared a screen recording reproducing the bug in theme editor page [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N68DZEL2pbOzJcciz42UO-eFZkT88rwd/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N68DZEL2pbOzJcciz42UO-eFZkT88rwd/view)

### Steps to reproduce

### Editing boxShadow on Theme Editor crashes page

- head over to -> https://ant.design/theme-editor
- scroll down to edit shadow properties for our theme
- open Map Token dropdown, and edit the properties.
- start typing in input fieid, the page crashes (white page is seen)
- I have reproduced this issue and provided you with gdrive screen recording of same

### What is expected?

User should be able to edit the boxShadow properties and customise it as per need.

### What is actually happening?

As soon as user starts typing in input field to edit boxShadow, it directly crashes the theme editor. [object Object] appears in input field and it breaks out.
