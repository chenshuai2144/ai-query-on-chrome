# Disable feature on Radio group works opposite between versions 4.x and 5.x

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-xtpfyr?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Just create a radio group that has "disable" defined with one condition (disabled={bool1}), and child button that is disabled with a different condition (disabled={bool2}).
I'd expect the child's disabled state to be effectively disabled={bool1 || bool2}

### What is expected?

To behave exactly like version 4.x, where if the Radio group is set disable, it will disable the whole component no matter if the child items are disabled or not.

Link here of version 4 working as expected:

### What is actually happening?

If each child button has its own "disable" defined, the group's "disable" is ignored

In the previous code, when the disabled of the radio itself is undefined or false, it will apply the disabled from the group. Therefore, when the group's disabled is true, the disabled of its internal radio will always be true, which leads to the internal radio not correctly applying its own disabled. This is incorrect.

It is intended in v5.

@MadCcc @Yuiai01 If it works opposite now on purpose, at least I think it should be mentioned in
[https://ant.design/docs/react/migration-v5](https://ant.design/docs/react/migration-v5)

Likewise if other components like "selects" have this "new way of working", it would be nice if it is clear and properly documented
