Ant Design radio group's `disable` property works differently between v4 and v5. In v4, if the parent radio group is set to be disabled, it will also disable all its child radio buttons regardless of their individual states. However, in v5, this behavior has changed so that if each child button has its own "disable" property defined, the group's "disable" property will be ignored. This means that if a child button is disabled separately, the parent radio group will still be enabled even if it is also set to be disabled.
