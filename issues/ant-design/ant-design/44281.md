# Bug Tabs and Tables when scroll attribute is set

`üêõ Bug`,`Inactive`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-tabs-table-bug-4tk5lv?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

Change between Tab 1 and Tab 2

### What is expected?

Smooth transition

### What is actually happening?

Table content is empty for a fraction of a second on tab transition, not showing the Empty component, resulting in an ugly transition effect.

| Environment | Info                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| antd        | 5.8.3                        |
| React       | 18.2.0                       |
| System      | windows 11                   |
| Browser     | Google Chrome 115.0.5790.171 |

The proper transition behavior can be seen when scroll attribute is not set in table components.

## DavideFrancescon

I think the issue is not on ant-design but on rc-table that is used to render the tables, you should probably open an issue on their repo, https://github.com/react-component/table/issues.

## bbb169

The table-body of the rc-table collapses when re-rendered, and the table-header of the ant has a height of 0, so it appears to be all cleared out, let me fix it

## ZWkang

It seems to have been resolved, and it no longer exists in the latest version.
