Request for adding simple mode pagination along with page size changer to Ant Design. Currently, simple mode can only be combined with total items, not page size changer. The proposed API allows users to switch between simple mode and normal pagination mode with a page size changer. The `showSizeChanger` prop is not working with the `simple` prop.
