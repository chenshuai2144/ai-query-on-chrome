This feature request is to allow the footer of a modal to support an optional `extraFooter` or the ability to pass a custom `render` function to customize the footer. The current implementation requires rewriting the entire footer and implementing the built-in confirm/cancel buttons manually, which can be cumbersome. The proposed solution would make it more flexible and convenient to add additional operations to the footer without having to rewrite the entire component.
