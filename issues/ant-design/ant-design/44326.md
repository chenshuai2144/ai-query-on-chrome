Hi, thanks for sharing the link, am not able to replicate it in
codesnadbox, but it's not even working on ANTD website, if you want I can
share a video with you, this is only happening in CHROME.

## izumshahid

you can close it. It was an issue with chrome version, thanks

## Davidvete

@izumshahid what exact issue with chrome version and how did you fix it? I am facing the same issue

## izumshahid

I updated my chrome, thought it's still not working properly, but it works
on incognito mode for now.

If you are facing this issue then i guess it should be reopned.

Even selects on AntD website are not working for me.
