  ## MadCcc

  The css of unhashed `a` came from components where `hashed` is `false`, so it is as expected.

  ## MadCcc

  What's your scenario for partially making `hashed` false?

  ## phatify

  Hi @MadCcc, I making hashed false partially in the component because I have a custom component that contains an `a` element, so I set the `hashed` theme to false to prevent the Ant Dropdown component from overriding my `a` element by css hash style. Currently, my custom component inside the dropdown are working as expected but in another component outside of dropdown will no longer be applied hashed from the theme hashed global config provider. I think it's a bug. In my reproduction link, you can see css in source code when open devtool, css for `a` will inject twice as globally (1st for hashed, 2nd for unhashed), it leads to disable global config theme hashed.

  ## phatify

  @MadCcc I think css for `a` should not be applied in case of nested theme hashed false if it is wrapped by a global config provider
