"ColorPicker does not support arbitrary data-attributes" - feature request to allow passing arbitrary data-attributes to the ColorPicker. Currently, only specific data attributes are supported and not others. A reproduction link is provided and the steps to reproduce are described. The expected outcome is for the data attributes to be spread to the element with the class "1️⃣ .ant-color-picker-color-block-inner" or "2️⃣ .ant-color-picker-color-block". Bonus points include identifying preset colors with a data-color attribute. The issue is occurring in versions 5.8.4 and higher of Ant Design.
