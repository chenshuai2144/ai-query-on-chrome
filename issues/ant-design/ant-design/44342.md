# Tabe filterIcon not working in React app with vite and npx

A bug is occurring where the filterIcon in an Ant Design table is not rendering. The error message is "Uncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports."
The issue can be reproduced by creating a new React app with vite and npx, adding an Ant Design table to the app.jsx file, and adding a filterIcon to the columns array. The expected behavior is for the filterIcon to console a string when clicked, but instead, an error is thrown.
The problem is caused by the filterDropdown prop not being given true, which is needed for the filterIcon to render. The suggested solution is to give the filterDropdown prop true, but without it, it is impossible to change the filterIcon.
The issue is new and has only occurred in projects created weeks ago.
