When using the `onSubmit` prop in an Ant Design Form, validation is triggered on both submit and user input. To skip validation on submit, you can use the `validateTrigger` prop to configure the trigger event for user interaction. However, this does not work for the `htmlType="submit"` button. To handle this, you can add a variable to handle the submit event separately.
