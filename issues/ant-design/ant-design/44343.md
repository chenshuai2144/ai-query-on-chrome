# Cannot skip rule validation on submit event setting validateTrigger to 'onChange'

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-n3q72l?file=/index.js)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create Form and use onSubmit prop to handle submit event;
2. Create Form.Item field and use rules prop to add any validation, for example `required: true` and set `validateTrigger: 'onChange'`;
3. Add `<Button htmlType="submit">Submit</Button>` inside Form;

### What is expected?

Validation is triggered only when user input some text and not on submit event.

### What is actually happening?

Validation is triggered also on submit.

| Environment | Info   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| antd        | 5.8.4  |
| React       | 18.1.0 |
| System      | MacOS  |
| Browser     | Chrome |

It would be nice to be able to skip validation on submit event also using htmlType submit button.

submit will trigger all the validate rules. `validateTrigger` is only used for config trigger event for the user interactive. You can add variable to handle this if needed:
