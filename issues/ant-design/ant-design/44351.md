Would this solve your problem?

You should give valid `filterDropdown` or `filters` to make it work.

@MadCcc no, i need open a modal on filterIcon click.

@MadCcc, good afternoon, the issue is still there, we tried with different versions of "andt" (5.3.2, 5.6.1, 5.8.4) and with different versions of "react". At first we tried it in a project created using yarn/vitejs, however, it is not an issue, because we also tried to use it a CRA and npm projects too. We also used different PC's. The issue still remains, it is impossible to use the filterIcon, as it gives the following error
"Uncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.". and the suggested solution is not useful, as without filterDropdown we can't change the filter Icon. filterDropdown: true is needed for putting and changing filterIcon.
It is a new bug, in projects that was created weeks ago the filterIcon can be changed.

## MadCcc

Seems it's a issue caused by https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/43002 , which make `filterDropdown` support `ref`.

Should take this scenario into consideration.
