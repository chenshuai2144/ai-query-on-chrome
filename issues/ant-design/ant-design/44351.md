The filterIcon in Ant Design Table does not work as expected. It throws an error saying "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined". The error is caused by a recent change in Ant Design Table's `filterDropdown` support, which makes it necessary to use `ref` for `filterDropdown`. The issue is not present in projects created weeks ago.
