Independent compilation of styles solves the problem of flickering styles caused by runtime application of styles in Ant Design v5. Two approaches are suggested: building styles independently using static-style-extract or inline styles using cssinjs. However, both have drawbacks such as loading styles at least twice, which may cause unnecessary duplication and increase the weight of each style file. The proposed solution involves excluding styles from the build to allow independent compilation and effective cache control, as well as providing an option to specify which components require styles or letting Ant Design automatically do so. Additionally, generating a CSS file using extractStyles from Ant Design will separate styles by components, reducing the amount of unused styles generated. While NextJS currently does not support dynamic generation of extracted CSS files, writing the CSS file for the server-side rendering side with other frameworks may be an alternative solution.
