Ant Design's `extractStyles` API allows for independent compilation of styles, which solves the problem of styles being loaded twice. However, styles for components that aren't used are still included in the HTML, leading to unnecessary duplication. The proposed solution is to exclude styles from the build and specify which components require styles.
