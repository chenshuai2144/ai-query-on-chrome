# [ColorPicker][presets] Encountered two children with the same key

`help wanted`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-9kgrnw)

### Steps to reproduce

Add two identical colors to the preset

### What is expected?

I understand that you may not have imagined what this could be, but this is a fairly normal user experience to have the same colors in the palette. Can you add also the index in the key?

### What is actually happening?

Encountered two children with the same key

| Environment | Info   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| antd        | 5.8.4  |
| React       | 18.2.0 |

Or maybe you can add a method in props, so we will be able to define how to generate keys yourself.
