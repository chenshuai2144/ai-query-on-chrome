ColorPicker in Ant Design is generating duplicate keys when adding the same color to the preset. This issue can be reproduced by adding two identical colors to the preset. The expected behavior is to have a unique key for each color, and the actual behavior is to encounter two children with the same key. A solution could be to add a method in props to allow the user to define how to generate keys themselves.
