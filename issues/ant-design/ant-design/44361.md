A reproduction link has been provided for a problem with duplicate keys in the `ColorPicker` component. The expected behavior is to allow for duplicate colors in the preset, and the actual behavior is encountering an error when two children have the same key. A solution suggested is adding a method to the props that allows users to define their own key generation logic.
