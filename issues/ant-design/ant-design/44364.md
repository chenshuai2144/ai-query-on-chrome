An issue in Next.js with the "App Router style how can be lazy loaded?" was reported. The issue occurred when using the custom theme with Next.js and the app router. The issue seems to be caused by using the `StyledComponentsRegistry` component provided by Ant Design. To solve this issue, a temporary workaround has been suggested to remove the `StyledComponentsRegistry` component from the layout where it causes problems.
