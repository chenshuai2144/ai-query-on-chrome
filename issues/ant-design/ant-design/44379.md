A `loading` icon appears unexpectedly in a `<Button>` component when using `react-freeze`. The issue can be reproduced by freezing and unfreezing the component, and it only occurs for a brief period of time. This behavior is unexpected, as the button should not display a loading icon unless specified. The problem occurs in version 5.8.4 of Ant Design with React 18.x on Windows 10 with the latest version of Chrome.
