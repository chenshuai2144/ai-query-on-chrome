The use of the `theme.useToken` hook in an Ant Design application causes the Next.js app to crash. The issue can be reproduced by creating a production build of the affected app and starting it. When navigating through the pages of the app, the app will crash. The expected behavior is for the app to work correctly and not crash. The problem occurs when the `theme.useToken` hook is added after the app has started. This causes the Next.js app to crash. The issue has been reported in the Ant Design repository and is marked as a duplicate of issue #44364.
