Using `theme.useToken` hook in an Ant Design application causes Next.js app to crash. The issue can be reproduced by creating a production build and starting it. The app crashes when navigating through pages. The expected behavior is for the app to work correctly. The problem occurs when the hook is added after the app has started, causing the Next.js app to crash. This issue has been reported in the Ant Design repository and is marked as a duplicate of issue #44364.
