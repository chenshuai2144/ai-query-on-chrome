It seems like you're trying to override the theme using a nested ConfigProvider, but you're not properly passing the updated theme to the child component. To fix this issue, you need to pass the updated theme object to the child component as a prop.
In your example, you're passing the theme object to the child component using the following code:

```javascript
<ConfigProvider
  theme={{
    algorithm: theme.defaultAlgorithm,
  }}
>
  <div
    style={{
      color: token.colorText,
      background: token.colorBgLayout,
      border: "2px solid red",
      padding: token.padding,
    }}
  >
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
</ConfigProvider>
```

However, in order to make the theme object available to the child component, you need to pass it as a prop to the child component like this:

```php-template
<ConfigProvider theme={theme}>
  <MyPage />
</ConfigProvider>
```

Make sure to replace `MyPage` with the actual component you want to override the theme for.
After making these changes, you should see the desired behavior where the style component is also affected by the updated theme.
