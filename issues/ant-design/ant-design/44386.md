# Breakpoint does not work when the screen size is xs

`üêõ Bug`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-usage-antd-5-8-4-forked-6sntlk?file=/demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Increase the size of window, the width of input field is normal (md: {span: 8})
2. Reduce the size of window till the width is less than 576px (sm)

### What is expected?

The width of the input field should not be changed

### What is actually happening?

The input field takes the full width even though the screen size is still big enough. So in this case, { xs: { span: 8 }} was ignored.

| Environment | Info   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| antd        | 5.8.3  |
| React       | 18.2.0 |
| System      | MacOS  |
| Browser     | Chrome |

Form has the logic that when screen size is less than sm it will become fully width for the input. But I think it should not override developer's config.

Yeah, in my case, I only need my users to enter few characters, so it is not necessary to have the full width even in the phone view.

Just a quick one, how can I apply the update on my side? What I did is reinstall the "antd" but that seems not apply the changes. Thanks
