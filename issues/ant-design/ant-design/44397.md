# Dropdown :Type error message when passing string value to align property

`help wanted`,`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/cascading-menu-antd-5-8-4-forked-vxw92r?file=/demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Passing string value(contain percentage) to 'offset' value in align property of Dropdown, to align the menu

### What is expected?

Menu will be align

### What is actually happening?

It work normally as I expected. But there is a message about type error at the 'offset' value. Same thing happened when I tried using visual studio code.
I've searched in internet and found that align property should use same syntax with the alignConfig object from https://github.com/yiminghe/dom-align, and here the docs said offset can be string contain percentage value.

| Environment | Info                 |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| antd        | 5.7.0                |
| React       | react 18.2.0         |
| System      | window 10            |
| Browser     | chrome 116.0.5845.97 |

popupOffset property in Menu.Submenu has the same problems (see the above code sandbox, line 35). When I try using the builtinPlacements property in Menu or Popover, it show no error in type if I pass a 'x%' value to offset or targetOffset (see the above code sandbox, line 47). Something is not synchronous here.
