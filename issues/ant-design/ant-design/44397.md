When passing a string value containing a percentage to the `offset` prop in the `align` property of a Dropdown, a type error message appears. This behavior can also be observed in Visual Studio Code. The issue seems to stem from the alignment configuration used in Ant Design's dropdowns and popovers. To resolve this issue, one solution is to use the `alignConfig` object and its properties like `offset`, `targetOffset`, etc.
