When passing a string value containing a percentage to the 'offset' property in the 'align' property of the Dropdown component, a type error message is displayed. This error occurs when using the 'popupOffset' property in the Submenu component of the Dropdown. When using the 'builtinPlacements' property in the Menu or Popover component, no error is displayed when passing a 'x%' value to the 'offset' or 'targetOffset' properties. This issue seems to be asynchronous.
