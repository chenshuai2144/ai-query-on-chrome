The RangePicker's defaultPickerValue does not update when the state containing it is changed. This can be reproduced by assigning a default state with some values to the defaultPickerValue property of a RangePicker, updating the state containing the defaultPickerValue, and observing that the RangePicker opens on the initial defaultPickerValue instead of the updated one. This issue can be resolved by using the `value` property instead of `defaultPickerValue` to set the initial value of the RangePicker.
