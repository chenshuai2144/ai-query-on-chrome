The `defaultPickerValue` prop of Ant Design's RangePicker component does not update when the state it is assigned to changes. This can lead to unexpected behavior where the picker opens on the initial value instead of the updated one. The issue can be reproduced in the provided CodeSandbox example, and is observed in both Chrome and Safari browsers. To fix this issue, you can manually call the `resetPickerValue` method when the state changes.
