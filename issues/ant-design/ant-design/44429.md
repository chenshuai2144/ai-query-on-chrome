Pls upgrade React to latest version. It's not consider a bug any more.

> ### Notable Changes
>
> - No warning about setState on unmounted components: Previously, React warned about memory leaks when you call setState on an unmounted component. This warning was added for subscriptions, but people primarily run into it in scenarios where setting state is fine, **and workarounds make the code worse**. We've [remove](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22114) this warning.
