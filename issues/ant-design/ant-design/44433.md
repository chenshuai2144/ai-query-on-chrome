Ant Design's CSS-in-JS library causes Next.js app to break in production mode. This issue can be reproduced by cloning the official example repository, installing dependencies, adding a Link component redirect to the home page, building and starting the app, and clicking on the "Go Home" link. In production mode, the app will throw a TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '1') error. The problem seems to come from the use of the StyleProvider component with the CSS-in-JS library. Removing the StyleProvider component resolves the issue, but adding it back causes the app to break again.
