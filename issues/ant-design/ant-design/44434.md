When using a `<Table>` component with an array of dataSource objects, you should avoid setting the "children" key in any of the objects. If you do, it will cause a TypeError when trying to render the table. Instead, you can use the "childrenColumnName" property in the dataSource configuration to specify a different column name to represent child rows.
