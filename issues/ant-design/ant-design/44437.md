When parsing an inputNumber with `min=0` or `max=100`, the `returnType` of the parser becomes an enumeration value, rather than a number. The expected behavior is for the `returnType` to be a number. This issue can be reproduced in version 4.22.8 of Ant Design with a MacBook M1 Ventura running Chrome 115.0.5790.170 and using React.
