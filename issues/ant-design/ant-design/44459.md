Carousel component in antd 5.8.4 has a warning in the browser console for the `slideCount` prop being passed in uppercase. The expected behavior is for the prop to be passed in smallcase, but it is currently being passed in uppercase. This warning can be resolved by spelling the prop as lowercase `slidecount` instead.
