# Tiny size classes

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I want to get a table and buttons that are more compact than small. Can I configure it via ConfigProvider for example?
For a more general approach, I prefer to have 'tiny' size options in components like tables, buttons, tabs, and so on.

### What does the proposed API look like?

size="tiny"

You can try `compact` theme:

PS: if you think compact algorithm is still large, you can create a customize algorithm to get it smaller : )
