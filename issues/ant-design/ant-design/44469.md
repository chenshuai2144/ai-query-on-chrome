`size="tiny"` is a new feature that allows users to customize the size of components like tables, buttons, and tabs to be more compact than the small size option. The feature solves the problem of wanting to have compact size options for these components. The proposed API looks like `size="tiny"`. The default algorithm is based on the `compact` theme, while the compact algorithm is designed to be smaller. The documentation can be found at <https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#algorithm>.
