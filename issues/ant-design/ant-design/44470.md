# A draggable and resizable grid layout with responsive breakpoints

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I want to archive https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout behavior with AntDesing components. Is it possible?

### What does the proposed API look like?

Option to make a grid draggable and resizable grid

But there is no drag and drop behaviour? It's just a layout
