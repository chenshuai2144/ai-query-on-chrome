2. shrink the page to xs or smaller
3. expand the page to lg or larger

### What is expected?

1. When shrink, there should be 3 dots or menu icon to make the header elements responsive
2. When expand, the 3 dots should be gone

When expand, the 3 dots didn't go away but have to refresh the page

Adding `<Menu style={{ minWidth: 0, flex: "auto" }} />` and `display: 'flex'` to parent (Col) does not solve the problem

Just to clarify the question, here is the screenshot

Everything's fine when the screen is large enough

Everything's fine when the page shrink (3 dots are expected)

But when expand the page from sm to lg, the 3 dots should be gone and shows all the buttons
