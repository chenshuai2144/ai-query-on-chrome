Request to allow direct export of `BasicDataNode` from `antd` library. Currently, TypeScript users need to redefine `fieldNames` to avoid type errors, but this can result in type errors. The best solution is to use an interface that extends `BasicDataNode`. However, when using npm as a package manager, this works without issue. When using pnpm as a package manager, it is not possible to directly export `BasicDataNode` from `rc-tree`. The proposed API is to import `BasicDataNode` from `antd` or `antd/lib/tree`. `TreeNode` is not enough and `BasicDataNode` is strange, it should have a more formal name. It is suggested to not export `BasicDataNode` from the root directory.
