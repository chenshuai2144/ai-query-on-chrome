# Feature Request: Allow direct export of BasicDataNode from antd

## Problem

Currently, it is common to need to redefine `fieldNames` in TypeScript, but it may result in type errors. The best solution is to use an interface that extends `BasicDataNode`.

```ts
import type { BasicDataNode } from "rc-tree";
interface TreeNode extends BasicDataNode {}
```

However, when using npm as a package manager, this works without issue. When using pnpm as a package manager, it is not possible to directly export `BasicDataNode` from `rc-tree`.
In this case, hoisting `rc-tree` is necessary, but it is unnecessary to hoist it just to export `BasicDataNode`.

## Proposed API

```ts
import type { BasicDataNode } from "antd";
```

or

```ts
import type { BasicDataNode } from "antd/lib/tree";
```

`TreeNode` is not enough

Can you try this

BasicDataNode is strange, it should have a more formal name.

Yeah, so we're not going to export it from the root directory.
