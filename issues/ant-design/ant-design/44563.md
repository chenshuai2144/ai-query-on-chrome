The `RangePicker` component in Ant Design version 5.8.5 does not work as expected when the `allowEmpty` prop is set to `true`. When the `allowEmpty` prop is set to `false`, the `onChange` event is triggered only when the calendar is closed. However, when the `allowEmpty` prop is set to `true`, the `onChange` event is fired on every date selection. This behavior can be fixed by using the `open` prop to control the value control.
