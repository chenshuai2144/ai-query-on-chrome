# Add support for dynamically setting Checkbox color

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

When using checkboxes for filters, it's useful to visually associate an option to a color. See e.g. how Google Calendar filter works.

### What does the proposed API look like?

| Props | Description                          | Type   | Default |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------- |
| color | Overrides the default checkbox color | String |         |

Though not best practice, with ConfigProvider, this could work as expected.

## MadCcc

We would not support `color` to change color of components, because there always some color like hover color or active color related with the origin color. And in antd, props will not affect cssinjs styles dynamicly, all we recommended to customize style is to use Token.
