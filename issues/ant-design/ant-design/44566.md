### Steps to reproduce

Create a Tabs components with the items inside a div/container trying to inherit height from parent div/container.

Expected for items to be able to get height from parent component (height: 100% should work [I Know that it works with vh but thats not the issue here])

With height being set to 100% it will grow with the items within and not be set to the max height possible in the parent container
