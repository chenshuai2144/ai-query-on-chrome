The README.md file for ant design contains a broken image link, which displays an incorrect version of the IssueHunt button. The broken link has been replaced with a working one that points to the correct GitHub page for IssueHunt materials. The updated code shows the correct URL for the IssueHunt button SVG image using a raw GitHub link.
