Antd Select component's onFocus not triggered when switching "disabled" prop. Expected behavior: onFocus should be triggered every time when select is focused on both selects. Steps to reproduce: 1) Click on First select → Saving occurs 2) Click on Second select → Saving occurs 3) Click on First select again → No saving occurs - no onFocus triggered 4) Click on Second select again → Saving occurs 5) Click on First select for third time → No saving occurs again - no onFocus triggered. Environment: - antd version: 5.8.6 - React version: 18.2.0 - System information: Windows 11 Home - Browser information: newest Chrome, Edge. Bug appears only when switching the "disabled" prop.
