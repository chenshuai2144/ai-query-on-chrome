When switching the "disabled" property of a Select component in Ant Design, the onFocus event is not triggered when the select is focused again. This only happens when the select is disabled and then enabled again. The issue can be reproduced by clicking on the First select, saving occurs, then clicking on the Second select, saving occurs, then clicking on the First select again, no saving occurs - no onFocus triggered, then clicking on the Second select again, saving occurs, then clicking on the First select for the third time, no saving occurs again - no onFocus triggered. This is happening only when switching "disabled" property.
