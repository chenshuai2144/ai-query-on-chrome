When importing a functional component that wraps Form.Item from a package, validation does not work properly. It only shows validation errors on submission, not on change. This issue can be reproduced in the provided CodeSandbox link. The expected behavior is for validation to work the same as in demos. The environment includes antd 5.3.0, React 17.0.2, and Chrome on Mac.
