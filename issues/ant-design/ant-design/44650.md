# DatePicker: prev state not resetting fully

The DatePicker component is caching its previous state, which causes the TimePicker to always increase by 5 minutes regardless of the number of times the user picks a date. This behavior is by design to keep the panel open when the form is reopened, but it can be problematic when the user wants to reset the form and start over.

To fix this issue, you can use the `useEffect` hook to re-mount the component when the form is reset. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { DatePicker, TimePicker } from "antd";

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (value) {
      setValue(null);
    }
  }, [value]);

  const handleReset = () => {
    setValue(null);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <DatePicker value={value} onChange={setValue} />
      <TimePicker value={value} onChange={setValue} />
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is called whenever the `value` state changes. If the `value` is not `null`, the `useEffect` hook calls the `setValue` function to reset the `value` to `null`. This ensures that the TimePicker is always reset to the default value of 5 minutes when the form is reset.
