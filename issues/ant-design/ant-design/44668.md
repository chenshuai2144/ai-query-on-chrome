Hey guys, applied this patch with patch-package and the issue still happens ( a lot less ).

NOTE: Actually the patch was not being correctly applied. After applying correctly, it worked üëç

I have same issue

## Grawl

@Comum can you show how exactly you applied a patch?

## Comum

I used [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) on my project.

- changed the node modules manually
- then ran `npx patrch-package rc-tabs`
