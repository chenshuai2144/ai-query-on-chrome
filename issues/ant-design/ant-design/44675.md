## Hellager

Pretty werid, but i found the problem.
The column `onFilter` type in component is `value: string | number | boolean, record: Item`.
If we define our own column's `onFilter` type to be like `value: number, record: Item`, it will throw errors that `value: number` is not compatiable with `value: string | number | boolean`.
So just keep them be the same as `string | number | boolean`
