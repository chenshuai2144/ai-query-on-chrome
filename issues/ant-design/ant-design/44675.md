When adding an `onFilter` property to a table column in Ant Design, TypeScript throws an error saying that the `mergedColumns` type is not assignable to the `columns` type. This error occurs because the `onFilter` property expects a type of `string | number | boolean`, while the `mergedColumns` type may include other types of values. To fix this issue, you can keep the `onFilter` property type as `string | number | boolean` and ensure that the `mergedColumns` type includes only these types of values.
