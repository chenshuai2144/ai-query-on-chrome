The `BorderRadius` token is not being reflected in the `Message` component, even though it is set in the `ConfigProvider` component. This issue can be reproduced in the provided CodeSandbox link and occurs in both the `Mossimos` and `MadCcc` examples. The expected behavior is for the `BorderRadius` to be updated to 2, but it is not being reflected in the component.
