The `Checkbox` and `RadioButton` components in Ant Design have a type definition issue with their `ref` prop. The `ref` prop is defined as an instance of `HTMLInputElement`, but in reality, it is an instance of `CheckboxRef` or `RadioButtonRef`. This causes issues when trying to pass the `ref` prop to the component, as the component receives the `ref`, but the type is not correct. This issue only affects the `Checkbox` and `RadioButton` components, as other input elements in Ant Design have a properly typed `InputRef`. To fix this issue, a pull request can be raised to update the type definition for the `ref` prop in the `Checkbox` and `RadioButton` components.
