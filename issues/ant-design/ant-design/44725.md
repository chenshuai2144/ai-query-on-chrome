# Checkbox ref has a wrong type definition

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/inspiring-chandrasekhar-yqn3wg?file=/src/App.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Import checkbox from ant.d
2. Create a simple ReactRef for this component with the type of `HTMLInputElement`
3. Try to pass the ref to the component
4. Component receives this ref, but in fact the type is not valid, since the ref is not of type `HTMLInputElement` but type of `CheckboxRef`

### What is expected?

The type for the `ref` should be correct `CheckboxRef` instead of `HTMLInputElement`

### What is actually happening?

Component receives this ref, but in fact the type is not valid, since the ref is not of type `HTMLInputElement` but in type of `CheckboxRef`

| Environment | Info                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| antd        | 5.9.0                           |
| React       | React                           |
| System      | Desktop (Windows mac)           |
| Browser     | All the latest browser versions |

Looks like also this is also affects the `RadioButton`, the other antd input elements works fine, since there is a properly typed `InputRef`
