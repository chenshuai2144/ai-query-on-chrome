"Popover design tokens don't work" in antd 5.9.0. The issue can be reproduced by adding a ConfigProvider and specifying width and minWidth tokens. The expected behavior is to modify the widths, but the actual behavior is that the tokens don't modify the widths. A possible solution is to use `overlayClassName` instead of `minWidth`.
