# Virtual Table component layout broken on few scenarios

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/virtual-list-antd-5-9-0-forked-ndmggl?file=/demo.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Create a virtual table and set the size. The table content is misaligned with the header

Layout is not working for the following scenarios:

1. on screen resize

https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/assets/52765572/9687d7e3-3278-4507-8978-6793f14878c4

2. When scroll.x is set to 'fit-content', when screen size is adjusted to smaller screen. Scroll x doesnt reveal all the columns
3. When size is specified e.g 'small' or 'middle'

### What is expected?

Layout should be aligned

### What is actually happening?

Layout is not aligned

Your reproduce is default one which not preset your description.

## AsuraKev

Updated link for scenario: specifying table size

What's the reproduce step of the codesandbox?

Same issues. #44785

## AsuraKev

In the RFC, its saying the cell wont auto adjust. Therefore we must explicitly specify width for each column, but specifying column width wont work with different screensize. It would be great to have the same behaviour as the normal Table :)

pls provide more info about this issue

## AsuraKev

@zombieJ the issue of this reproduce https://codesandbox.io/s/virtual-list-antd-5-9-0-forked-ndmggl?file=/demo.tsx is that table content is not aligned with table header when you specified the size
