Virtual Table height is fixed when `scroll.y` is set and number of row items are few. The issue can be reproduced in the provided reproduction link. The expected behavior is for `scroll.y` to only be triggered when the table rows exceed the specified number, but currently it is applied regardless of the number of row items. This occurs in both the browser and system environments with Ant Design version 5.9.0 and React version 18.2.
