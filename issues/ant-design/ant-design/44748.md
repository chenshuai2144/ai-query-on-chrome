Virtual table height is fixed when scroll.y is set and number of row items are little. This issue occurs when setting scroll.y to a fixed value and the number of row items is small. The table height remains fixed even if the items do not take up that much height. This behavior is unexpected and should be changed so that scroll.y is only triggered when the table rows exceed the specified number.
