Ant Design has a feature called `extractStyle` that allows you to extract styles from your application and compile them into a separate file. This file can then be loaded by your application and used to style your components. However, the current implementation of this feature requires SSR, which means that the styles will be compiled at runtime and loaded by the browser. This can result in a slow initial loading time and may not be suitable for production environments.
