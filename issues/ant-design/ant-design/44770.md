A proposal has been made to extract Ant Design styles into a separate file to avoid duplication and improve performance when using Ant Design with Next.js. The current implementation requires generating CSS files at runtime, resulting in a delay of 2-3 seconds before the page loads. The suggestion is to allow Ant Design to compile styles into a single bundle that can be used without the need for `@ant-design/cssinjs`.
