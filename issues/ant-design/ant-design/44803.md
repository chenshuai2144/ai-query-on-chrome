`🐛 Bug`,`👷🏻‍♂️ Someone working on it`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/controlled-tree-antd-5-9-0-forked-y2hrkg)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a checkbox tree with nodes with long text
2. Set width of tree to a small number so text wraps

### What is expected?

The checkbox should be aligned to the top of the node

### What is actually happening?

The checkbox is centered which makes it hard to distinguish each node
