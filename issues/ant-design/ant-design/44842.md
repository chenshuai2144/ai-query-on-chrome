`ConfigProvider` allows customization of component styles, but only one variant can be defined. Adding a `token` prop to each component would give more control over customization. Proposed API: `<Switch token={{ handleBg: "red" }}>...</Switch>`. The `theme` option in `ConfigProvider` can be used to wrap components, but it's not suitable for use in components.
