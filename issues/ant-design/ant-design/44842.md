# Allow passing design 'token' at the component level

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

The `ConfigProvider` design tokens introduced in `5.x` offer a convenient way to customize component styles, but it does not support defining multiple "variants" of the same component.

Adding a `token` prop to each component would allow for even more control of component customization.

### What does the proposed API look like?

```tsx
export const DangerSwitch = (props: SwitchProps) => (
  <Switch token={{ handleBg: "red" }} {...props} />
);
```

Just wrap components in ConfigProvider:

```
<ConfigProvider theme={{ components: { Switch: {...}} }}>
  <Switch />
</ConfigProvider>
```

`theme` works with Provider of context, which is not suitable to implement in components.
