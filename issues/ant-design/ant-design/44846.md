This issue is about a custom select in AntD that does not automatically select the added value and close the dropdown when the value is added. The user has tried setting the value through the value prop on the Select component, but it always selects the added value instead of allowing them to select more options from the dropdown. The user has also tried setting the value after the async options are ready, but it did not work.
