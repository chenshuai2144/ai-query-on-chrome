# When using Email and Password, autoComplete=off is not working

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Hi. I'm currently using NextJS and am having problems when both the email and password fields are present in the component. The autoComplete='off' property is not working. This would result in an autofill text with a bright blue background for each of them. Background and autofill are not desired by the client.

### What does the proposed API look like?

n/a
