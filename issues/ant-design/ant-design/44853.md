# hover in dropdown üêõ Bug

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[https://ant.design/components/dropdown](https://ant.design/components/dropdown)

### Steps to reproduce

You can use the second example in https://ant.design/components/dropdown. When you select an item from dropdown, it will move to a new tab. Let's go back to the example and hover the cursor over dropdown. The hover status on the selected menu will remain. And this is unexpected because dropdown has closed. I assume this is due to the attribute target="\_blank"

### What is expected?

When you select an item from dropdown, it will move to a new tab. Let's go back to the example and hover the cursor over dropdown. The hover state at the selected point is reset.

### What is actually happening?

The hover status on the selected menu will remain. And this is unexpected because dropdown has closed.
