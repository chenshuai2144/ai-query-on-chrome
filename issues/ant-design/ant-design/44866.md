Antd styles are overriding explicit Tailwind CSS classes in a Next.js 13 app with the App Router. This can be reproduced by creating a new Next.js app with Tailwind and installing Antd. Adding a Tailwind height class to a layout with a header results in Antd styles taking precedence over Tailwind classes. The issue can be resolved by removing the StyledComponentsRegistry or by increasing the priority of Tailwind CSS.
