Antd styles are taking precedence over Tailwind classes in a Next.js 13 app with the use of App Router. This can be reproduced by following these steps:

1. Create a new Next.js 13 app with Tailwind installed.
2. Install Antd.
3. Add a layout with a header that includes Tailwind's `height` class.
4. Observe that Antd styles are overriding the explicit Tailwind classes.

Expected behavior: Classnames should override Antd styles.
Actual behavior: Antd styles are overriding explicit classnames.
Environment information: Next.js 13, Antd 5.9.0, React 18.2, Chrome browser.
