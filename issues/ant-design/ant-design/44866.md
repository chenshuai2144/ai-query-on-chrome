Removing StyledComponentsRegistry seems to work. whats the purpose of StyledComponentsRegistry?

## MadCcc

Without `StyledComponentsRegistry`, styles will not be generated in server rendering.

You have to try to raise the priority of tailwindcss, please try `important`.

Going to closing this issue cuz nothing could be done with antd.
