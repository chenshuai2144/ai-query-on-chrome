### Reproduction link

[https://github.com/GeorgiyBeloklokov/antd-issue-table.git](https://github.com/GeorgiyBeloklokov/antd-issue-table.git)

### Steps to reproduce

install Vite: 4.3.9, Yarn, React :18.2.0 Antd: 5.9.0 Styled-components: 6.0.1 // in App.tsx place this code and npm run start

### What is expected?

I have a box, it has 7 rows and 10 columns, I set the length of the rows to 1200 pixels and the height of the box to 500 pixels and expect a horizontal scroll to appear so that I can see the entire length of the rows

### What is actually happening?

when I set the height of the box (Y axis) to be greater than its content, there is no horizontal scroll and my 15 columns are not visible.
