Button transition doesn't work when it's wrapped with Tooltip in Ant Design v5.9.0. This issue can be reproduced by wrapping a Button component with Tooltip Component and it occurs only when button is disabled or has a custom style applied. To fix this issue, the Trigger logic in Tooltip needs to be migrated to use Pointer Events.
