The Upload component in Ant Design Next.js stopped working and is stuck at "Loading..."状态, with a POST request error of "net::ERR_FAILED 503 Service Unavailable". After trying to access the mocky.io endpoint directly, I received an HTTP error 404. The issue has been resolved by applying the fix suggested in this GitHub issue.
