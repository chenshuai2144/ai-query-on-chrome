### Steps to reproduce

1. Wrap ConfigProvider component inside a component
2. Pass a theme prop inside ConfigProvider with an object

````javascript
<ConfigProvider theme={{
          token: {
            colorError: "#0000ff"
          },
          components: {
            Message: {
              contentBg: "#000"
            }
          }
        }}
/>```

3. Inside de wrapped component, run a message.error('Error message')

### What is expected?

That the params inside the theme object on ConfigProvider changes the style of ant wrapped components

### What is actually happening?

Changes in theme object does not affect on wrapped components

Attempted to use an object within the 'components' property, using the keys "Message" and "message", as well as various parameters within the 'token' and 'components' properties. However, none of these were reflected in the message component, even though they were successfully reflected in the other components
