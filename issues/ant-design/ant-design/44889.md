Is this same as #44745 ?

## AsuraKev

oh yep, its mentioned there as well :)

## zombieJ

Could you help to simplify the codesandbox and record video by the codesandbox demo? Thus I can debug on this.

## AsuraKev

This recording is using the Codesandbox directly from the virtual table from the documentation. Hope this helps :) thanks
