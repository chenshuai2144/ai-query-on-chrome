# Remove click in tooltip sort Table Column

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Hi, I think the sort tooltip in the columns should be only informative and not fulfill the action function.

### What does the proposed API look like?

As shown in this image, the tooltip hides the buttons I have in the header and this affects the usability because instead of clicking on the button I click on the tooltip and it messes up the table, with an action by accident.
