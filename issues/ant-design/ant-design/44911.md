Thank you for sharing the information and providing the video. It seems like there is an issue with the height of the input field not being consistent when using the `auto-fill` feature in Edge on Windows. This issue may be related to the browser's implementation of the `auto-fill` feature or the way the Ant Design form component is handling it.
To better understand and reproduce this issue, we would need access to a codebase or a minimal reproduction repository that can showcase this behavior. It would also help if you could provide more details about the setup you are using (version of Ant Design, version of React, version of Node.js, etc.). We will try our best to help you with this issue.
