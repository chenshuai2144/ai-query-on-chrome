# FeedbackIcons does not appear with multiple form items

`🐛 Bug`,`👷🏻‍♂️ Someone working on it`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-rv2mc2)

### Steps to reproduce

Create a classic form, add a 1st form.item with a feedback warning, add a 2nd intermediate form.item ( noStyle ) then an input

```
const App = () => {
  const [form] = Form.useForm();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>antd version: {version}</h1>
      <Form form={form}>
        <Form.Item
          label="Test"
          htmlFor="test"
          hasFeedback
          validateStatus="warning"
        >
          <Form.Item name="test" noStyle>
            <Input />
          </Form.Item>
        </Form.Item>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### What is expected?

The input should have an orange border as well as the warning icon

### What is actually happening?

The input only has an orange border

The bug appeared since 5.9.0 (management of feedbackIcons I think)

Hello, I have checked your code and made some modifications. It appears to be that you're using a nested <Form.Item /> which respectfully I don't see any need to here. If you have some need to keep your code in the same structure you can just move the `hasFeedback` and `validateStatus="warning"` to the second <Form.Item /> and it should work just fine

Hello, thank you for your answer. For this ticket, I simplified the code, but in reality I have dynamic form management, with a first Field component which manages all the logic (including feedback), and then different components (input, textarea, select, radio) which is the 2nd form item. Of course, I will be able to manage the feedback in all my second level components but it is not optimal: duplicated code, heavy maintainability...
