When `scrollX` set to not a number, it will fallback to `scrollX: 1`. Which should warning developer that in virtual table it only accept number type.

## AsuraKev

@zombieJ if you set a static number for scroll.x, how will it handle different screen sizes? e.g if I set scroll.x = 1600, it might look ok on screen with width 2000px but not on 3000px ...
