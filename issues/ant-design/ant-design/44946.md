InputReadOnly is not working as expected in table when DatePicker is touched. The virtual keyboard is showing even though the inputMode attribute is set to none. This issue occurs in Ant Design version 5.9.1 with React 18.2 on a Mac and Chrome browser. A possible solution involves setting the inputMode attribute to none after componentDidMount.
