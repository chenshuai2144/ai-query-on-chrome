# Datepicker: Missing `showWeekNumbers` Attribute

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I expect the Ant Design **Datepicker** component to have an attribute called **showWeekNumbers** that allows users to display week numbers alongside the date selection without automatically selecting the whole week.

### What does the proposed API look like?

I propose adding a new attribute showWeekNumbers to the Datepicker component, which can be set to **true** or **false** depending on whether the user wants to display week numbers alongside date selection.

```
<DatePicker
   picker="date"
   format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
   showTime
   showNow={false}
   showWeekNumbers={true}
/>
```
