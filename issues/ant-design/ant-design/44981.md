This feature allows users to customize the color of the scrollbar thumb based on their preferences or the current theme. The current default color is `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`. A suggested API would be a `theme` property called `scrollbarThumbColor`. To override the default, use a className selector in CSS.
