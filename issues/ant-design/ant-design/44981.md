# Select scrollbar-thumb styling

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

It'll be able to specify color of scrollbar-thumb based on user/developer preferences or current theme (_day, night_). For now it's always **`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`**.

P.S. I know that it is possible to set virtual to false and then native scrollbar will appear, but for my case virtual scroll is required.

### What does the proposed API look like?

I think it should be theme property, something like `scrollbarThumbColor` or any better name.

className selector is still work. You can override it easily:
