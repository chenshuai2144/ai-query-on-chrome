# Allow forceRender feature in Tree.TreeNode component

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

Just like `Collapse.Panel` and `TabPane`, `TreeNode` should have an `forceRender` to have the component to be loaded even they are not visable.

### What does the proposed API look like?

`forceRender`: Force rendering of content in collapsed `Treenode`. Type `boolean`, default `false`
