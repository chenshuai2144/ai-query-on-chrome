Add design tokens for Button to support underline, hover underline, and hover bold. This allows for better control of button text styling, such as enabling a link button to appear underlined or to go from non-bold to bold when hovered. The proposed API includes design tokens for `textDecoration`, `hoverFontWeight`, and `hoverTextDecoration`. It is recommended to customize with classes to override styles for link buttons, as these are not common variants for Ant Design.
