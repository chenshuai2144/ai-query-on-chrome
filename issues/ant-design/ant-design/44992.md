Bug report for `rc-picker` in controlled mode where the `onOpenChange` event does not trigger when opening and closing the panel. The issue can be reproduced using the provided reproduction link and steps to reproduce. The expected behavior is that the panel should close after clicking "OK", but it remains open without any callback. This bug affects version 5.9.2 of `antd` and is present even with a controlled state passed down from the parent component. It seems to be related to the `rc-picker` library itself, as reproducing the issue using a different date picker library does not result in the same behavior. The bug was initially identified by `pengfan2013` and followed up by `Yuiai01`.
