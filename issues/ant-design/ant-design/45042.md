A feature request has been made to expose the `motionDeadline` prop in the Modal component in the Ant Design library. This is needed to resolve an issue in micro frontend architecture where related styles are removed during modal confirm, causing the rc-motion animation to fail, making the modal not dismiss and preventing the body from scrolling. A reproduction link and a code snippet have been provided to illustrate the issue. Proposed solution is to add `motionDeadline` prop to Modal component and allow configuration of the Modal.method property.
