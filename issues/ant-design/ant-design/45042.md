# Feature Wanted: rc-motion motionDeadline in Modal component

This feature aims to solve the problem of rc-motion animation not being able to complete when switching between sub-systems in a micro-frontend system, causing the Modal component to remain and the body to be unable to scroll. This issue can be reproduced in the following CodeSandbox: <https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-rgb-57vlzg?file=/src/App.js>. The solution proposed is to expose the rc-motion motionDeadline configuration in the Modal component, and to allow the Modal.method to be configured.
