Ant Design's DatePicker component does not allow keyboard accessibility for certain controls. Repro steps: navigate to the Calendar demo on CodePen, expand a calendar field, and verify that keyboard access is limited. Expected behavior: all controls in the Calendar should be accessible via keyboard. Actual behavior: some controls are not accessible via keyboard. This issue affects versions of Ant Design, React, and the operating system and browser being used. Solution: shift + pgUp/pgDn may work as a temporary workaround, but a more permanent solution is needed.
