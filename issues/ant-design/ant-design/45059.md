This is an issue with the ant design dropdown component when rendering as a column table instead of a menu. It seems that the `React.Children.only()` method is causing an error because there is no type information available for the child elements being rendered. One solution would be to use `React.cloneElement()` to clone each element and add the necessary type information, like this:

```javascript
const children = React.Children.toArray(dropover.props.children);
const cloneChildren = children.map((child) =>
  React.cloneElement(child, {
    type: child.type,
  }),
);
return <div>{cloneChildren}</div>;
```

Another solution would be to modify the `renderOverlay` function in the `Dropdown` component to handle the case where the children are rendered as a column table, like this:

```scss
function renderOverlay({ visible }) {
  const children = React.Children.toArray(visible ? dropdown.props.children : []);

  if (visible && children.length === 1) {
    // Render the child as a column table if there's only one child
    return React.createElement(DropdownTable, { children });
  }

  return children;
}
```

These solutions should resolve the issue and allow the dropdown component to properly render as either a column table or a menu.
