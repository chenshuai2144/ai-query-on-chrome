The select component in version 4.24.14 does not display a scrollbar, while it does in version 4.24.8. This issue can be reproduced by clicking on the select component. The expected behavior is for the scrollbar to display, but it does not. The environment includes antd 4.24.14, React 18.2, Windows 11, and Chrome 117.0.5938.92.
