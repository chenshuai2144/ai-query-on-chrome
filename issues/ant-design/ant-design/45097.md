### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/empty-paper-fgg3kd?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A26%2C1)

### Steps to reproduce

click the show button, then you will see

### What is expected?

This was normal in older versions because the container on the outer layer of antd had max-width:100% set, but it seems to have been removed in recent versions, which is causing the problem.

### What is actually happening?
