An issue with the `antd` modal component occurs where tables overflow when there is not enough space for them. This happens because the container on the outer layer of `antd` has `max-width:100%` set, which has been removed in recent versions. The solution is to wrap the table in a container that sets its width. A code sandbox link has been provided for reference.
