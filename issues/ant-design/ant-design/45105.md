ANTD library doesn't work properly in Windows 11's Edge browser in IE11 mode. To fix it, enable filling gaps in the polyfill document (<https://4x-ant-design.antgroup.com/docs/react/introduce-cn#%E5%85%BC%E5%AE%B9%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83>) or use compatibility configuration for V5 to support IE11. Consider upgrading to the latest version if migrating from v3.
