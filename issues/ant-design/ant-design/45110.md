Before this I also found this problem, at first thought it was designed so, after all, open the pop-up window is an animation, you can quickly click the trigger button, this is better to look at the core members of the judgment. Thank you very much for your feedback!

It makes sence since `Modal.confirm` create different modals when clicked

You could make mask `pointer-events: auto !import`
