# TABS component classNames

### What problem does this feature solve?

Hi, I'd like to create a status **error className** on tabs, Now I added a danger button but it hasn't good result and cannot add error **className** to tab link.

Example:

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
item: "demo tab",
classNames: "demo-here"
```

Yes, it's the same I did but with danger button.
As you can see tab border is not red color.

My code:

```
{
      label: <Button type="text" danger={tabErrors === "addresses"}>Addresses</Button>,
      key: "addresses",
      children: (<p>demo</p>)
}
```

I'll provide an approximate solution, written rather roughly.

Hi, problem is when you have like 5 tabs, it mantains the red color for all of them, how to managed the classname based on state key of the tab?
beucase i save the error key in a state to know which tab is danger and which not
