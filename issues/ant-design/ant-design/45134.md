The documentation for `Notification.useNotification()` does not support getting the container element, which was previously possible in version 4.x. This can lead to issues when trying to mount the notification element on a specific DOM node, as seen in the reproduction link. The solution suggested is to use the `useNotification` hook provided by Ant Design instead of using `Notification.useNotification()`.
