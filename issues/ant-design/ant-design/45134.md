The documentation for `Notification.useNotification()` does not support using `getContainer` and it is not working as expected in version 5.9.3 of Ant Design. The expected behavior is for the notification element to be mounted on a specific container, but it is currently being mounted on `document.body`. This issue can be reproduced by clicking on the "Open the notification box" button in the provided CodeSandbox link. The expected behavior is for the notification element to be mounted on a specific container, but it is currently being mounted on `document.body`.
