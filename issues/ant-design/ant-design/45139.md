Hi, your reproduce is empty.

I think that if the parent node is selected, then all the child nodes should also be selected (currently not selected), and when all the child nodes are selected, the parent node should be selected as well. Both of these situations can be considered as one node. When selecting child nodes under the parent node, the count of nodes should be based on whether all of them are selected or not.

You should use `showCheckedStrategy={TreeSelect.SHOW_ALL}`

@MadCcc Thank you so much, iam feeling stupid not fully reading API.
There it is clear:
Default: just show child nodes.
TreeSelect.SHOW_ALL | TreeSelect.SHOW_PARENT | TreeSelect.SHOW_CHILD
