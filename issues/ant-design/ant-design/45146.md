Modal and DatePicker in TypeScript version 2.3.2 produce error TS2322. To fix this, you need to lower the version of @types/react to 17.x. On the other hand, Icon requires upgrading @types/react to version 18.x to solve the problem. This conflict needs to be resolved.
Reproduction: [http://no-repo.com](http://no-repo.com)
Steps to reproduce:

- Compile the code
  Expected result: No errors
  Actual result: Errors related to Modal and DatePicker
  Environment information:
- Ant Design version: 4.19.3
- React version: 16.13.1
- System information: macOS Monterey 12.1, not system-related
- Browser information: Latest version of Chrome, not browser-related
  The actual issue seems to be caused by the introduction of an external library (https://github.com/EddieUp/antd-table-saveas-excel) into the project. The issue does not involve the packaging tool or Ant Design itself.
