### Steps to reproduce

![bug](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/assets/49230105/6a14ae5c-e1f9-4954-8ba9-6b4ca88e8b5b)

https://gifyu.com/image/S6bC6 Here is the gif with the reproduction steps. You can test in your site menu example.
Collapse inline menu to vertical => hover item with submenu => select any item of submenu => expand vertical menu to inline menu => expand the item with submenu where you previously selected item => expand and collapse the submenu

### What is expected?

Submenus from vertical mode should not flicker when opening and closing submenus in inline mode.

### What is actually happening?

Submenus from vertical mode flicker when opening and closing submenus in inline mode. If I once opened a submenu in vertical mode and selected some element, the flickering will remain until I reload the page.

I just made a menu on my project and discovered this flickering problem. It is also present on your website as an example of using the menu.

There is indeed an issue. when collapsing the submenu, it appears in the wrong position.
