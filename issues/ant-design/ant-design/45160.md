When selecting a sub-item in a vertical mode menu and then expanding the resulting inline menu, the sub-menu flickers as it opens and closes. This is observed both in the codepen reproduction link and on the ant design website. The issue persists even after refreshing the page. The bug seems to be related to the positioning of the sub-menu after it is expanded.
