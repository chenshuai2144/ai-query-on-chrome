DatePicker in extra footer with Radio.Button closes interface after click in antd 5.9.4, React 18, and Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge. Expected behavior is that the Radio group should not close the interface like the button version. Temporary solution is to re-focus the field after it closes, but debugging is difficult and frustrating.
