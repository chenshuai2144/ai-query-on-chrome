DatePicker in extra footer with Radio.Button closes interface after click. Reproduced in CodeSandbox. Expected behavior is that the Radio group should not close the interface like the button version. Using antd 5.9.4, React 18, and Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge. Temporary solution is to re-focus the field after it closes, but debugging is difficult and frustrating. Duplicate of #33125.
