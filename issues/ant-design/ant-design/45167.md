The feature request is for a way to change the maximum height of a virtual table in Ant Design, specifically to 100vh. The current default maximum height is set at 500px, which is not sufficient for some use cases. The proposed solution is to add a new prop to the `<Table>` component called "virtual height", which can be set to "100vh".
