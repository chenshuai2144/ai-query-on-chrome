# Virtualized table max height

`ðŸ¤” Need Reproduce`,`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

is there a way to change height of virtual table in and design?
i want to create a table of 100vh but i noticed that class="rc-virtual-list-holder" is set to max-height of 500px that is not enough.
and i dont see any option to change this value

### What does the proposed API look like?

```
<Table virtual height={"100vh"} ...{otheroptions}>
```

@konstantinsp I am use `scroll` prop to control the table height.
