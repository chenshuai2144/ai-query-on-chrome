The Select component in antd has an unnecessary `aria-label` attribute that overrides the label provided through the `Form.Item`. This causes issue when using a `Form.Item` with a `label` property and a `Select` within it. To fix this issue, the `aria-label` prop should be removed from the `Select` and the user should be responsible for providing a `<label>` for the `Select`.
