When collapsing or expanding the side bar in a React application using Ant Design v5.9.3, a UI glitch may occur. This can be reproduced in the demo linked in the original post, which uses the `sideBar` component from Ant Design. The bug does not always appear and requires continuous collapsing and expanding of the side bar to trigger it. It has been reported as "unconfirmed" and needs further investigation. The environment includes Ant Design v5.9.3, React v18.2.0, and Firefox version 118 on Linux Mint 21.2 cinnamon.
