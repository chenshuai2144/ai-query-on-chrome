I dont know why the box shadow is bugged on this recording..

Perhaps should add an active state style to its menu item after clicking.

Because `getPopupContainer={(trigger) => trigger.parentElement!}` makes Popconfirm inside menu item.
I believe that you add this configuration due to `z-index` problem, we have a RFC on it: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/discussions/45154

Currently you can set `z-index` of Popconfirm separately with ConfigProvider `theme`.

```
<ConfigProvider
  theme={{
    components: {
      Popconfirm: {
        zIndexPopup: 1000
      }
    }
  }}
>
```
