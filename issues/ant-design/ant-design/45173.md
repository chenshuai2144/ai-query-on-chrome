When a dropdown menu item is clicked, a popconfirm appears and the dropdown menu remains open. When the mouse is moved outside of the dropdown menu and then back in, the highlight on the selected dropdown items changes even when the popconfirm is still open. This is because the popconfirm extends the highlighting effect/hovering. To fix this, you can add an active state style to the menu item after clicking. This issue is related to the `z-index` problem and can be resolved by setting the `z-index` of the Popconfirm separately with the ConfigProvider `theme`.
