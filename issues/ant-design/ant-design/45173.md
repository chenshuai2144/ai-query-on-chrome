The issue is caused by the `getPopupContainer={(trigger) => trigger.parentElement!}` configuration in the code, which makes Popconfirm appear within the menu item's parent element. This causes the highlighting effect to persist even when the popconfirm is closed. To fix the issue, you can add the following code to set the z-index of the Popconfirm separately with the `ConfigProvider` component:

```
<ConfigProvider
  theme={{
    components: {
      Popconfirm: {
        zIndexPopup: 1000
      }
    }
  }}
>
```

This will ensure that the Popconfirm has a higher z-index than the menu item, allowing the highlighting effect to properly disappear when the popconfirm is closed.
