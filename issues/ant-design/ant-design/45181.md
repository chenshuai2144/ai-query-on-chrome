The input number component allows letters when text is inserted, even though it should be disabled by default for numbers only. This issue can be reproduced by creating an input number component and trying to insert text, which will disappear upon clicking outside of the component. The expected behavior is not allowing letters to be entered, but currently they are allowed. This issue occurs in version 5.9.2 of antd and in versions 18 and higher of React. It has been reported on both Mac and Chrome browsers.
