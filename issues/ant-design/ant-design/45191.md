After upgrading from antd 4.x to the latest 5.9.4, the project fails to compile due to a "Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/alert/style/css'" error. The issue can be resolved by commenting out the use of the babel-plugin-import "libraryName" option with "antd" and "libraryDirectory" option with "es" and "style" option with "css". However, this will cause a new error of "Attempted import error: 'Icon' is not exported from 'antd'". To fix this, the Icon component should be migrated according to the documentation.
