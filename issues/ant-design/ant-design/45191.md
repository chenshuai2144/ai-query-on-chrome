# Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/alert/style/css' after upgrade from v4 to v5

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[http://the-problem-occurs-in-a-private-repo-after-upgrade](http://the-problem-occurs-in-a-private-repo-after-upgrade)

### Steps to reproduce

yarn upgrade antd --latest
yarn add @ant-design/compatible@v5-compatible-v4
yarn add @ant-design/pro-layout
yarn add @ant-design/moment-webpack-plugin --dev
npx -p @ant-design/codemod-v5 antd5-codemod src

### What is expected?

After upgrading the project from antd 4.x to the latest 5.9.4, it is not able to compile anymore.
I expect the project to be compiled w/o errors and running fine.

### What is actually happening?

Can't compile the project: Module not found: Can't resolve 'antd/es/alert/style/css' in '.../src/containers/Admin/Mailing/Campaign'. If I comment out the Alert component in the Campaign file the same error occurs for another one.

v5 is a css-in-js project. Not include any CSS.

## dsocha

I know, this is why I'm surprised. I've double checked and I don't have any antd/css references in the project.

## yoyo837

Are you using babel-plugin-importï¼Ÿ

## dsocha

Yes, I am.
"babel-plugin-import": "^1.12.2"

## yoyo837

That's the problem, stop using it.

## dsocha

      // fixBabelImports('import', {
      //   libraryName: 'antd',
      //   libraryDirectory: 'es',
      //   style: 'css',
      // }),

I've commented out above and the error doesn't occur anymore.

But now it fails with:
Attempted import error: 'Icon' is not exported from 'antd'.

From what I see 'Icon' from 'antd' is used more than 200 times in 80 files in the project. Is there any way to globally fix the problem or do I need to replace manually all occurrences?

## yoyo837

`antd` no longer exports Icon since 4.x, please follow the documentation to migrate https://4x.ant.design/docs/react/migration-v4#Icon-upgrade
