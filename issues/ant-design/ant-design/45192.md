| React       | 18.2.0                 |

I change the font family, if I don't use another font, it will work. But I think it should not be the problem of custom font.

Noticed that you are using your own font family, which make line height different from antd.

Icon is maked aligned with first line, and this would be broken if you use different font-family since we will not apply center alignment to icons and texts for multiple lines.

You could align them yourself by overriding the styles in your app currently, which may be a workaround.
