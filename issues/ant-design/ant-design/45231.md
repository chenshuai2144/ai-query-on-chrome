Bug report for an extra tab appearing in the dropdown menu when the screen size is shrunk and the last tab is not visible. The bug only occurs with Russian localization. No active tab should be displayed in the dropdown menu, and any hidden tabs should be visible. The cause of the issue is due to incorrect width calculations in the `useVisibleRange` hook of `rc-tabs`. A reproduction link has been provided.
