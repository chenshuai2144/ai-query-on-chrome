# Extra tab in the dropDownMenu with RU localization

`🐛 Bug`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/relaxed-cohen-6yrk2f?file=/src/App.js)

### Steps to reproduce

You need to shrink the screen so that the last tab is not visible and open it through the dropDownMenu. The dropDownMenu will display those tabs that are not visible and the last (only RU localization!)

### What is expected?

There is no active tab in the dropDownMenu and those tabs that are not visible visually are visible

### What is actually happening?

The extra tab appears in the dropDownMenu

补充一下这里的分析，我看了一下 rc-tabs 的实现，这里的 useVisibleRange，貌似这里的导致的原因都是因为取值都是 offsetxxx 导致的取整，从而使得宽度计算取数错误。
Let me further supplement the analysis here. After examining the implementation of rc-tabs, it seems that the issue in useVisibleRange is caused by rounding the values obtained using offsetxxx, which leads to incorrect width calculations.

还可以查看这个 [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-frog-9jw2sy) 即使它不是使用俄语。
You can also checkout this repo [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-frog-9jw2sy) even if it's not in RU.
