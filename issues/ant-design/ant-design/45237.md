When using the `ConfigProvider` to increase the `zIndexPopupBase` value, the confirmation modal does not receive the same `zIndex` as the regular modal and is displayed below it. This is because the static methods of the Modal component cannot consume the `ConfigProvider`. To fix this, you can use the `useModal` hook or the `App` component.
