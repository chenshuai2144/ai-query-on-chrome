The problem is that `ConfigProvider` affects all the components in your application, including `Menu` used in the `Dropdown`. To fix this, you can wrap the `Dropdown` component with `ConfigProvider` and apply the theme there instead.

```typescript
<ConfigProvider theme={{ components: { Menu: { itemSelectedColor: 'red' } } }}>
  <Dropdown />
</ConfigProvider>
```

This way, the theme will only affect the `Dropdown` component and its children, like the `Menu` component.
