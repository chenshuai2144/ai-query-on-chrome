A bug occurs where segmented component icons move when switching between values in Safari version 16.6 and above. This issue can be reproduced by having a segmented component with icons/icons only in Safari and switching between values. The expected behavior is for the icons not to change position, but instead they move. This bug has been reported in versions of Safari from 16.1 to the latest version.
