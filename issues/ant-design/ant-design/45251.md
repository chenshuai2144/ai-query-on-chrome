# Hide table column if empty

`unconfirmed`

### What problem does this feature solve?

I would like to hide a column in a table if the data/render is empty.

For example, if a user doesn't have a `role`, I don't want to show the column `Role`. Right now, it will show the column with an empty cell. The only workaround to hide a column is to set the width at `0` - but it's not dynamic.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Make the `width` dynamic like the `render`, so based on the `record` I can be able to show or hide that column by setting the width to 0 or not.

Try `onCell`

@afc163 I don't get how `onCell` can solve my problems as it takes an event ?
