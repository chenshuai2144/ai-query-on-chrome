Feature request: Add a new `onCell` prop to the `Table` component that allows developers to dynamically hide columns if their data is empty. The `onCell` function should receive a row and cell object and return a boolean value indicating whether the column should be hidden or not. If the column is hidden, its width should be set to 0.
