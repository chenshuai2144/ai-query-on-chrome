Bug in Ant Design 5.10.0: Button with `loading={delay: 0}` doesn't display loading as expected on Windows 10 and Chrome 117.0.5938.134. Reproduction steps: Visit <https://codesandbox.io/s/dawn-brook-gwmy2q?file=/src/App.js> and notice that the button doesn't show loading even though the delay is set to 0. Expected behavior: The button should show loading when delay is set to 0. Actual behavior: The button does not show loading. Note: This appears to be a bug.
