Ant Design's Tree component in version 5 suffers from decreased performance when rendering large virtual lists, as shown in this CodeSandbox link (<https://codesandbox.io/s/xu-ni-gun-dong-antd-5-10-0-forked-9ssy97?file=/demo.tsx>). The issue is caused by a new tooltip implementation that triggers layout calculations during scrolling, leading to significant performance hits, especially for large virtual lists. One potential solution involves optimizing the CSS-in-JS code responsible for generating the tooltip styles, but this may come at the cost of compatibility and ease of use.
