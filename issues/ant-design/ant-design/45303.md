The "Select", "Tree Select", "AutoComplete" and "Cascader" components in Ant Design are missing the "activeShadow" design token. The reproduction link and steps to reproduce are provided. The expected behavior is that these components should have the same shadow token as the "Input" and "Datepicker" components. Currently, the actual behavior is that the design token is missing. The issue was identified in version 5.10.0 of Ant Design and is still present in the latest version (as of September 2021).
