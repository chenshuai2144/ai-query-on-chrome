A new Space Context feature has been introduced to maintain consistency between APIs and simplify page development. The current `Space` and `Space Compact` both have a `size` attribute, but their meanings differ. There is often a set of buttons in a functional area (such as a fixed footer) that requires all large-sized buttons. The current implementation requires manually setting the `size` for each button. The proposed API allows consumers of `Space` or `Space Compact` to consume a `SizeContext`. This will break compatibility with previous versions and require a change to the naming convention. A potential solution is to use the `ConfigProvider` component to set a global `componentSize` instead of `Space`, which only consumes `SizeContext`.
