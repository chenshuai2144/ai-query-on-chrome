This is about a custom request function in the `Upload` component provided by Ant Design. The function takes some options as input and exports them to an interface named `RcCustomRequestOptions`. However, the exported interface is not defined and cannot be imported or used directly. The user wants the function to be made available for import and use, possibly by defining the `RcCustomRequestOptions` interface.
