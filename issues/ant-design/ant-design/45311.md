How about this https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-reproduction-template-forked-jhnzmk?file=/index.js

It seems that the config generated by the theme-editor is incorrect.

That's what I am talking about. Instead of `"dark"` should be `theme.darkAlgorithm` as said in documentation: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#use-prese

## MadCcc

In Theme Editor, algorithms have a protocol: `dark` and `compact` will be automaticly converted to `theme.darkAlgorithm` and `theme.compactAlgorithm`, for dynamicly saving in localStorage.

But antd do not handle it, you need to replace it when copying it into your code.

Maybe it's better to leave a tip.
