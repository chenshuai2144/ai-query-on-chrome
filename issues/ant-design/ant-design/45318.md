This feature request is for an option to allow the drawer to be pushed content instead of overlaying it. The current implementation only allows for the drawer to overlay the page. This can be problematic in certain situations where it would be useful to be able to resize the main content while still being able to access the drawer content. A suggested solution is to add a new prop called `overlay={false}` or update the current `push` prop to target the content of the container it is in. An example of how this could be implemented is provided using TypeScript.
