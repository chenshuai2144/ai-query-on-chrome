I want to confirm that if dont dynamic change the icon, will it still have the bug?

## philippechevieux

I've forked the sandbox to have a static icon : https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-tooltip-not-hidding-when-moving-cursor-fast-forked-64nzgh?file=/index.js

And in this case there is no bug anymore

## zombieJ

Check the node find that its caused by React will not trigger `onMouseLeave` event when node quick flash. I wrap the icon with `pointEvents: none` also fix this:

## zombieJ

Since the event is bubble by React, I'm afraid we can do nothing on the component level:

(Event not trigger)
