antd's `Tabs` component has an issue where setting `destroyInactiveTabPane` at the tab level does not work as expected, causing the `useEffect` hook to only fire the first time the tab is opened. The problem appears to be that the prop is applied to the tab level instead of the pane level, as stated in the source code. A possible solution could be to update the documentation or implementation to reflect the correct usage of the prop.
