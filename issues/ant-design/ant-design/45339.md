The tooltip is not working correctly in a Datepicker cell when using the `cellRender` method and hovering over it. This issue occurs in version 5.10.0 of Ant Design. The problem does not occur when using the `defaultOpen` prop, but the tooltip only appears once when the page loads. To fix the issue, the `:before` element used in the DatePicker cell needs to be patched for events.
