AutoComplete is a input component. So the value by you pass is `first` but option value is `268`. It will never match each other.
If you want to be the label not align with value, use Select + `labelInValue` to support customize input instead.

Thank for answer @zombieJ
I can't use the Select component for search. When I place the cursor in the input field, then I cannot change the current value and the cursor at the beginning of the line. Can I somehow make the property labelInValue for the Autocomplete?
