This proposal adds a new property called `stopTriggerPropogation` to the `Dropdown.Button` component to prevent the trigger from propogating clicks when it's clicked within a collapsed `Collapse.Panel`. The current workaround involves taking control of the trigger, which can be costly for common use-cases.
