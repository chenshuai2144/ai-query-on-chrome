### What problem does this feature solve?

Tooltip in the columns should be only informative and not fulfill the action function.

### What does the proposed API look like?

Should be able to control table sort tooltip actions

Now you're showing the title as "Click to sort", how the user are going to know whether it is ascending sort or descending sort?

See https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/45403 the fix.

Can you provide a sample code I couldn't get it.

```typescript showSorterTooltip: {
        overlayStyle: {
          pointerEvents: "none",
        },
        title:"click to sort" // I need to show whether it is ascending , descending or cancel sort text here
      },

```

You can remove `title` safely to see the original title in next patch of antd (5.10.2), which is fixed in https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/45403
