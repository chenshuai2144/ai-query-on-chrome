I need to reproduce the behavior of using a custom date library with the TimeRangePicker in Ant Design. The current implementation makes it impossible to use a custom date library, as the TimePicker has been replaced with a DatePicker. I found a reference document that explains how to do this, but the API for the TimeRangePicker.RangePicker component is not specified. Can you please provide the necessary API information?
