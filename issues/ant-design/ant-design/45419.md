Next.js doesn't support custom links in buttons, you need to use the Link component and pass href as props.

```javascript
import { Link } from "next/link";

<Button href="/my-next-page" passHref>
  Click me
</Button>;
```

This way, clicking on the button will only navigate to the specified page and not refresh the entire page.
