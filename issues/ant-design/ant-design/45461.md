# Submitting a nested form triggers outer Form submit handler

`unconfirmed`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/29drdw?file=/app.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

When a native <form> is rendered as a child of <Form> (e.g. using a portal so that output HTML is syntactically correct), the submit handler of the inner form triggers submission of the outer Form component. Nesting antd Form components works correctly.

### What is expected?

The outer Form submit handler is not triggered when the inner form is submitted

### What is actually happening?

Both forms are submitted
