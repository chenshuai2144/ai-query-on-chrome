The documentation for Ant Design's Modal component mentions using the `styles` prop to apply styles to the wrapper element, but this is causing TypeScript errors because the `styles` prop has been defined with an `Omit<ModalStyles, "wrapper">` type. The issue is that the `styles` prop expects a `ModalStyles` object with only the "body" and "head" props, and does not allow the addition of a "wrapper" property. To resolve this, it may be necessary to omit the "wrapper" property from the `styles` prop definition.
