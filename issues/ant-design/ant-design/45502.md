This code snippet uses the `antd` library to display a date picker with time in a specific timezone specified by the `timezone` prop passed to it. The picker will always show the date and time in the specified timezone, regardless of the user's local timezone. It also includes an option to select a different timezone from a list of available options using a segmented control.
