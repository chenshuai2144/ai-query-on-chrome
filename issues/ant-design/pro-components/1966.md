Hi,

Thanks for reaching out! We appreciate your feedback and suggestions. The community is always working on improving our components and adding new features.

As an alternative to editing mode, you can try the use of Filterable Table component from @umijs/antd-pro.

It has a built-in search bar that allows users to filter data in real-time, and the table displays only matching records, which helps to improve performance. You can customize the filters to match your specific needs.

Please let us know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
