# Form syncToUrl bug: data not cleared on reset

When resetting a form using the syncToUrl function in the ProForm component, the data is not cleared. This bug can be reproduced by visiting the following link: <https://procomponents.ant.design/~demos/form-sync-to-url-1?useMode=chapter&startTime=2021-02-25&endTime=2021-03-25&name=%E8%9A%82%E8%9A%81%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8>

## Reproduction steps

1. Visit the link provided.
2. Click the reset button.
3. The time data is not cleared.

## Proposed solution

To fix this bug, it is suggested to add a check in the onReset function to call the syncToUrl function if it is defined. This will ensure that the data is cleared when the form is reset.
