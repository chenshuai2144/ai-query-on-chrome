To fix the issue of the width not being applied to the table in the editableProTable component, you can try adding the `width` property to the `formItemProps` object and passing it to the `Form.Item` component. This will ensure that the width is applied to the input field within the table cell.

```typescript
{
  title: '描述',
  dataIndex: 'decs',
  formItemProps: {
    width: 500,
  },
},
```

Additionally, you can try adding the `overflow-x: auto` property to the `.ant-table-content` element to prevent the table from overflowing when the width is set. This can be done by adding the following CSS rule to your project:

```css
.ant-table-content {
  overflow-x: auto;
}
```

This should ensure that the table cell width is applied correctly and the table does not overflow when the width is set.
