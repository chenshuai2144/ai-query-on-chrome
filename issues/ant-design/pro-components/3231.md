The "bug" described is that when using the `ProFormUploadDragger` component in ProComponents, the `onChange` event is triggered twice after uploading a file. This issue has been reported by several users and was first mentioned in 2021. The problem persists even after upgrading to the latest version of ProComponents. A possible solution involves adding an extra check to determine whether the `onChange` function has already been called before triggering it again.
