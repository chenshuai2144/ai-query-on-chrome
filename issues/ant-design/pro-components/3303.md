When I change the language of the application Arabic which is from right to left the side menu stayed on the left though the design did shift to the right to left mentality.
You can check this Bug on the [pro preview design website](https://preview.pro.ant.design/) when the language is set to Farsi (IR)

Thank you for reaching out with your issue. It looks like the side menu in `ProLayout` isn't properly shifting to the right when the language is set to a right-to-left layout, such as Arabic or Farsi.

One way to solve this issue is by setting the `direction` CSS property to `rtl` on the specific element that isn't shifting. In this case, it seems like the `SiderMenu` component of `ProLayout` is the element that needs this property set.

You can try this code snippet to add the `direction: rtl` property to the `SiderMenu`:

```css
.ant-pro-sider-menu {
  direction: rtl;
}
```

You can add this code either in a separate CSS file or in-line in the component itself.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
