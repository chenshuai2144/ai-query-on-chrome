To resolve the issue where a ProFormSelect value is not being cleared after selecting a different option in another ProFormSelect using ProFormDependency, add a custom `onChange` function to both selects that updates the selected value for both and uses the updated value to check if there has been a change. If there has been no change, clear the previously selected value by setting it to `undefined`.
