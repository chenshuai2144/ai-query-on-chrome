This issue is related to the ProTable component in Ant Design. When the "reset" button is clicked, the label for the dynamic form item remains even if the form item is not rendered. This is because the ProTable component uses a `queryFilterOption` method to reset the form, which does not properly clear the form items. To fix this issue, you can use the `manualRequest` property of the ProTable component to disable the default reset behavior and use the `resetFields` method of the ProForm component to clear the form items. Additionally, you can use a `useEffect` hook to remove any empty form items from the table when the form is reset.
