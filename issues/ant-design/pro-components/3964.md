Performance issue with ProTable in dynamic columns and custom valueType

Problem description:
When using ProTable in dynamic columns and custom valueType, switching tabs triggers a request that takes approximately 2 seconds. Additionally, when rendering custom valueType, the function is repeatedly called.

Reproduction steps:

1. Load ProTable with dynamic columns and custom valueType
2. Switch between tabs

Expected result:
Table performance should be similar to Ant Design's table.

Actual results:
Table performance is significantly slower than Ant Design's table.
