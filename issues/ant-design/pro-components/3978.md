# ProTable Toolbar Customization with action buttons on the left

`table`,`🎖️  featrue`,`AI Reply`

Dear developers,

I really love ProTable. By default the toolbar's action buttons are aligned on the right. I would like to have the option to align on the left. This is helpful and more user-friendly on extra large screens that display a full-width table. Assuming that you read from left to right, the advantage is that you have to go for shorter distances with you mouse.

I put the action button inside headerTitle instead of toolBarRender

To achieve the desired result of putting the action buttons on the left side of the ProTable toolbar, you can use the `headerTitle` property instead of `toolBarRender`. `headerTitle` allows you to customize the table header section with your own React component. Here's an example code snippet:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ProTable from "@ant-design/pro-table";

const columns = [
  {
    title: "Name",
    dataIndex: "name",
    key: "name",
  },
  {
    title: "Email",
    dataIndex: "email",
    key: "email",
  },
  {
    title: "Age",
    dataIndex: "age",
    key: "age",
  },
];

const data = [
  {
    key: "1",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "johndoe@example.com",
    age: 32,
  },
  {
    key: "2",
    name: "Jane Smith",
    email: "janesmith@example.com",
    age: 25,
  },
];

const MyTable = () => {
  const renderToolbar = () => {
    return <div>Some custom content on the right</div>;
  };

  const renderHeaderTitle = () => {
    return (
      <div
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "flex-start",
          alignItems: "center",
        }}
      >
        <div style={{ marginRight: "20px" }}>
          Some custom content on the left
        </div>
        <div>{renderToolbar()}</div>
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <ProTable
      columns={columns}
      dataSource={data}
      headerTitle={renderHeaderTitle}
    />
  );
};

export default MyTable;
```

In this example, we define a new function called `renderHeaderTitle` which returns a custom component with two `<div>`s that are arranged side by side using `display: 'flex'`. The first `<div>` contains the action buttons we want to put on the left of the toolbar. The second `<div>` contains the existing custom content we want to show on the right. Finally, we pass `renderHeaderTitle` to `headerTitle` property on the `ProTable` component.
