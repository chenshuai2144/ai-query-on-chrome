# Bug in ProTable: Select fieldProps.options not updating after data change

Summary: When the underlying data changes in a ProTable, the `fieldProps.options` prop is not updating.
Reproduction: Use provided CodeSandbox link: <https://codesandbox.io/s/qing-liang-shai-xuan-ti-huan-cha-xun-biao-dan-forked-ebldt?file=/App.tsx>
Environment: - @ant-design/pro-table: "2.56.9" - React: v17.x - Browser: Any modern browser
Root cause: When the data changes, the table is caching the column configuration. The `renderFormItem` prop is not triggered to refresh the select box because the original options passed to the `fieldProps.options` prop have already been cached.
Workaround: Pass a unique key prop to the ProTable so that it re-renders and calls the `renderFormItem` prop function. Alternatively, remove `fieldProps.options` from the `renderFormItem` and instead use a `select` in the customRender of ProTable.
Feedback: Please provide any additional feedback or report any other issues.
