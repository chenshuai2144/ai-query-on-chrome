The problem is that the `fieldProps.options` are only passed once to the form, so the table does not know that the option has been updated. The solutions are to either remove `fieldProps.options` from the renderFormItem and use a `select` in the customRender, or pass a unique key prop to the `Protable` so that it re-renders and calls the `renderFormItem` prop function.
