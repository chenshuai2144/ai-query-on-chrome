Hi @WuJiy,

I assume you're talking about the issue with the `react-sortable-hoc` library being unmaintained and wondering if there are any plans to migrate to `dnd-kit`. As far as I know, there aren't any concrete plans to do so at the moment.

However, if you're interested in contributing to the `react-sortable-hoc` library or migrating to `dnd-kit`, you're welcome to create a Pull Request with your proposed changes. The maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback on the next steps forward.

If you decide to contribute, please remember to provide documentation, test cases, and ensure that CI passes.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help with.
