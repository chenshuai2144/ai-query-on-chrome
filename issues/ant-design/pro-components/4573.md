Using ProLayout is causing an error when running `yarn dev` or `yarn build`. The error message is related to import statements and the project doesn't seem to support them. It looks like the issue might be caused by the ProLayout package, but the exact cause is not clear. One possible solution is to set up a loader for less in the next.config.js file.
