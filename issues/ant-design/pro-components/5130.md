You can wrap the `Link` element in a `React.Fragment` and use that as a child of the `Menu.Item`. This will ensure that the `Link` element is only rendered once, even though it is present multiple times in the `Menu.Item`.
Here's an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Menu
        onClick={() => window.history.push("/home")}
        items={[
          {
            key: "/home",
            icon: <HomeOutlined />,
            label: "Home",
          },
        ]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This will result in the following behavior:

- The first time the user clicks on the "Home" item in the menu, they will be taken to the "/home" route.
- Subsequent clicks on the same "Home" item will not trigger a page reload, because the `Link` element has been wrapped in a `React.Fragment`.

Note that this assumes that the `window.history.push` method works correctly in your application, and that the `/home` route is defined properly in your routing configuration.
