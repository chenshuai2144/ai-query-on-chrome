A bug occurs in versions of pro-table after 2.56.0 where the `columnsState` settings or "fixed: 'left'" do not work correctly when `shouldCellUpdate` has its own logic. When the column moves and is fixed to the left, it remains in the same position and is covered by another column until hovered over.
