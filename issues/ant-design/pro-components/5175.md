Bug: `shouldCellUpdate` and `columnsState` do not work together properly. When `shouldCellUpdate` function has its own logic (not `shouldCellUpdate: () => true`), the column that is fixed to the left becomes shadowed by other columns after moving. Only after hovering, the issue disappears (I guess it re-renders). Reproduce: 1. Open columnState settings (cogwheel) 2. Move column "Test1" to be first (so that "Test" column would be second) 3. Try scrolling columns to the left - enjoy interesting view. Expected result: Columns should render the same as with `shouldCellUpdate: () => true` when columnState being changed. Reproduce code: `js { title: "Test", dataIndex: "test", fixed: "left", width: 100, shouldCellUpdate: (record, prevRecord) => { console.log(record); return record["test"] !== prevRecord["test"]; } }, { title: "Test1", dataIndex: "test1", fixed: "left", width: 100, shouldCellUpdate: (record, prevRecord) => { return record["test1"] !== prevRecord["test1"]; } }, ` Dependency versions: - ProComponets pro-table: 2.73.0 - umi 3.5.20 - Brave Latest - macOS 12.3.1
