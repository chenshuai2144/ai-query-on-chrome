# EditableProTable rows in name mode have duplicate keys causing issues with nested tables.

## Problem

In name mode, rows are assigned an index instead of a unique key. This causes issues when editing nested tables, as child rows have the same indexes as their parents, making row keys no longer unique. This leads to child rows not being editable or deletable.

## Reproduce Code

To reproduce the issue, look at the test <https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/blob/d882705b6c2e98e6261e981509b24a62ad66b56c/tests/table/editor-table-two.test.tsx#L823>. When editing a nested row, the row index is used instead of a unique key, causing issues with row deletion and editing.

## Solution

To fix the issue, a unique key should be assigned to each row in the nested table. This can be achieved by modifying the `rowKey` prop of the `EditableProTable` component to use a unique identifier for each row.
