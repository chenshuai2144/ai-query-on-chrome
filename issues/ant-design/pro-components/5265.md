# 🐛[BUG] EditableProTable rows don't have unique keys in `name` mode

## 🐛 Bug Description

In `name` mode, EditableProTable assigns an index to each row. `editableUtils.actionRender` uses row index instead of row key to edit and delete rows. This causes issues when editing nested tables, as child rows have the same indexes as their parents, making row keys no longer unique.

## 🤔 Problem

This works for flat tables but not for nested tables. In the current implementation, when a table has nested rows, child rows have the same indexes as their parents. This means row indexes are no longer unique. Because child rows have duplicate keys, they are not editable or deletable.

## 💻 Reproduce Code

The easiest way to reproduce this is to look at this test: <https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/blob/d882705b6c2e98e6261e981509b24a62ad66b56c/tests/table/editor-table-two.test.tsx#L823>. The problem arises when we change the test to edit a nested row, `6246912293` (child of `624748504`). There is no easy way to refer to row `6246912293` by row index.
