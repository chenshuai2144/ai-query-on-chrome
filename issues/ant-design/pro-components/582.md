Yes, you can use the `babel-plugin-import` plugin to resolve the issue. Here's an example configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      "import",
      {
        libraryName: "antd",
        libraryDirectory: "es",
        style: true,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

This will tell Babel to import modules from the `antd` library in the `es` directory and to include styles as well. You may also need to specify the `style` option if you're using CSS modules.
