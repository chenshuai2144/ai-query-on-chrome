Bug in BetaSchemaForm: collapsed section data not validated on form submit. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create collapsible group 2. Make one field invalid 3. Collapse group 4. Submit form. Expected: `onFinish` not called due to validation error. Actual: `onFinish` called. Fixed by https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/commit/769177f5acdad0126fd146e8e6a1346a7c21d882.
