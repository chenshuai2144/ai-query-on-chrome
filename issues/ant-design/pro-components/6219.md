# 🧐[问题] Is it possible to force open a specific collapsed group within a list?

I have a list of collapsible groups, groups are collapsed by default. When I add a new entity to the list, I'd like its section to be expanded right away, while not affecting the state of other entities within the list. Is there any way to do it?

You can manually configure the expansion and collapse and encapsulate it into a component to store this logic
