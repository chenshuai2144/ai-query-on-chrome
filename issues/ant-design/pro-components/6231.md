The issue you're facing is related to the validation message for the required field in ProForm Select. The required message is not displaying when using the `requiredMark` prop in `FormItemLabelProps`. To fix this, you can use the `validateMessage` prop of `ProFormSelect` instead. Here's an example:

```jsx
<ProFormSelect
  name="memberShips"
  label=" "
  colon={false}
  request={searchListMembership}
  mode="multiple"
  validateMessage="Please select member ships!"
  requiredMark={false}
  rules={[{ required: true, message: "Please select member ships!" }]}
  fieldProps={{ showArrow: true }}
/>
```

This will display the required message whenever the user tries to submit the form without selecting any member ships.
