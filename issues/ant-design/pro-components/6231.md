The `requiredMark` prop in `FormItemLabelProps` is used to show or hide the required star in the label of a form item. To hide the required star, you can set `requiredMark` to `false` in the `FormItemLabelProps` of the form item. To specify validation rules for a form item, you can use the `rules` prop in the `FormItemLabelProps`. The `rules` prop is an array of validation rules that will be applied to the form item. If any of the rules fail, the form item will be marked as invalid and the error message will be displayed.
