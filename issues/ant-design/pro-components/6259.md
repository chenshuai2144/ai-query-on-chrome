You are experiencing a build issue with importing `isEqual` from `fast-deep-equal` in your file while using ProComponents version 2.3.34 and Umi version 3.1.3. Try installing `fast-deep-equal` as a dependency, importing it as a named import, or modifying the `webpack` configuration in your `umi` config file to include the `babel-loader` configuration. If the issue persists, report it on Stack Overflow or UmiJS GitHub issues.
