Hi there,

Based on the information provided, it seems that you are experiencing a build issue with importing `isEqual` from `fast-deep-equal` in your file while using ProComponents version 2.3.34 and Umi version 3.1.3.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that `fast-deep-equal` is installed as a dependency in your project by running the command `npm install fast-deep-equal`.

2. Try importing `isEqual` as a named import with curly braces like this:

```
import { isEqual } from 'fast-deep-equal';
```

3. If you still encounter issues with the build, try changing the `webpack` configuration in your `umi` config file to include the proper `babel-loader` configuration like this:

```
chainWebpack(config) {
  config.module
    .rule('js')
    .use('babel-loader')
    .tap(options => {
      // modify the options...
      options.plugins.push('fast-deep-equal');
      return options;
    });
},
```

Here, we are modifying the `babel-loader` options to include the `fast-deep-equal` plugin.

I hope this helps you resolve your build issue. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.

Also, keep in mind that Stack Overflow and UmiJS GitHub issues are right places to report the issues related with usage of UmiJS.
