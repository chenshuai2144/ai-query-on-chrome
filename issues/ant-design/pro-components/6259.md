This is an issue with importing `isEqual` from `fast-deep-equal` in a file when building with ProComponents 2.3.34 and Umi 3.1.3. To fix it, try installing `fast-deep-equal` as a dependency and importing it as a named import or modifying the webpack configuration in the `umi` config file to include the `babel-loader` configuration with the `fast-deep-equal` plugin.
