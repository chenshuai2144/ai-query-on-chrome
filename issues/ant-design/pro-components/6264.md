It seems that the issue you are encountering is related to the use of `React.StrictMode`. Removing `<React.StrictMode>` should resolve the error for now.
If you want to keep using `React.StrictMode`, you can try adding `!important` after `Outport` or `Layout` components, like this:

```javascript
<Layout>
  <Outlet !important/>
</Layout>
```

This should override any styles applied by `React.StrictMode` and prevent it from affecting the layout.
Please note that this solution may have unintended consequences and is not recommended in all cases. It's always better to investigate the root cause of the issue and fix it properly rather than relying on workarounds.
