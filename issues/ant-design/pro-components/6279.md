The issue is that the EditableProTable component does not have a `name` property, which is required for adding new rows. When the `name` property is not set, the component only allows adding one row. When the `name` property is set, the component allows adding multiple rows, but it cannot add initial data. To fix this issue, you can either set the `name` property or use the `recordCreatorProps` prop to add initial data.
