# Cannot use import statement outside a module

This error occurs when you try to import a module outside of a module in JavaScript. In other words, you cannot use an import statement in a script file, but only in a module file.

For example, if you have a script file called `script.js` that looks like this:

```javascript
import { PageHeader } from "@ant-design/pro-components";
```

And you try to run this script file, you will get the error `Cannot use import statement outside a module`.

To fix this error, you need to move the import statement inside a module file. For example, you can create a new file called `module.js` and move the import statement there:

```javascript
// module.js
import { PageHeader } from "@ant-design/pro-components";
```

Then, you can require this module in your script file like this:

```javascript
// script.js
const PageHeader = require("./module.js").PageHeader;
```

This will allow you to use the `PageHeader` component in your script file without getting the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error.
