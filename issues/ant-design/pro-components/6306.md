Layout token not valid on mobile screen with recurrence code [code image]. Expected result is that the token should work on mobile devices. This occurs in version Ant Design Pro 4.23.3, umi 4.0.24, using Chrome on Windows. Additionally, different tokens are used for drawers and pages, but a single token cannot satisfy both conditions. The issue also includes maskclosable #6305 being unsupported and no suitable solution found.
