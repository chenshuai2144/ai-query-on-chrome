A possible solution to the bug caused by installing `@ant-design/pro-components` is to replace the `react-sortable-hoc` package with `react-dnd`. The migration process involves installing the necessary packages (`react-dnd` and `react-dnd-html5-backend`) and importing the corresponding HOCs from `react-dnd` (`DndProvider` and `DragSource`). A tutorial on how to do this can be found at <https://blog.jakoblind.no/react-dnd-tutorial>.
