### What problem does this feature solve?

I got an error when running `npm i @ant-design/pro-components --save` installation command.

```
npm WARN ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency
npm WARN While resolving: react-sortable-hoc@2.0.0
npm WARN Found: react@18.2.0
npm WARN node_modules/react
npm WARN peer react@">=16.0.0" from @ant-design/cssinjs@1.1.0

npm WARN node_modules/antd
npm WARN 66 more (@ant-design/icons, @ant-design/pro-card, ...)
```

After investigating the problem, it turned out that the react-sortable-hoc package is no longer supported. There is a message about this in the README of the project.

### What does the proposed API look like?

The earner recommends replacing this package with https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit

This seems to _still_ be an issue. Any updates on a PR @folt?

I tried to change dependencies, but dnd-kit has a slightly different interface.

I see. Can you provide more details about the issue you're facing? Maybe someone in the community can help you find a way to migrate to dnd-kit.

@chenshuai2144 After adding `@ant-design/pro-layout` or `@ant-design/pro-components`, the warnings are shown any time we run `npm install`.

The concerned package is abandoned and the react version has not been updated. https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/blob/caf3c4f5bfb30894639391ae75c1bfc2b707a127/package.json#L57

You can try using a package called `react-dnd` instead of `dnd-kit`. It has similar functionality to the abandoned `react-sortable-hoc` package.

To migrate from `react-sortable-hoc` to `react-dnd`, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the react-dnd packages:

   ```
   npm install --save react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
   ```

2. Replace the import of the `SortableContainer` HOC from react-sortable-hoc with `DndProvider` HOC from react-dnd:

   ```js
   // Before:
   import { SortableContainer } from "react-sortable-hoc";

   const MySortableList = SortableContainer((props) => (
     <ul {...props}>{/* ...items */}</ul>
   ));

   // After:
   import { DndProvider } from "react-dnd";
   import { HTML5Backend } from "react-dnd-html5-backend";

   const MySortableList = (props) => (
     <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
       <ul {...props}>{/* ...items */}</ul>
     </DndProvider>
   );
   ```

3. Replace the `SortableElement` HOC with `DragSource` from react-dnd:

   ```js
   // Before:
   import { SortableElement } from "react-sortable-hoc";

   const MySortableItem = SortableElement(({ value }) => <li>{value}</li>);

   // After:
   import { DragSource } from "react-dnd";

   const ItemTypes = { CARD: "card" };

   const cardSource = {
     beginDrag(props) {
       return {
         id: props.id,
         index: props.index,
       };
     },
   };

   function collect(connect, monitor) {
     return {
       connectDragSource: connect.dragSource(),
       isDragging: monitor.isDragging(),
     };
   }

   const MySortableItem = ({ connectDragSource, isDragging, value }) => {
     const opacity = isDragging ? 0.4 : 1;
     return connectDragSource(
       <li style={{ opacity }} className="card-item">
         {value}
       </li>,
     );
   };

   MySortableItem = DragSource(
     ItemTypes.CARD,
     cardSource,
     collect,
   )(MySortableItem);
   ```
