# üêõ[BUG] SettingDrawer is not hidden in production environment

### üêõ bug SettingDrawer is not hidden in production environment

I cannot close the Drawer when it is opened.
In the production mode, the SettingDrawer and MenuDrawer (in mobile responsive) can't be closed.

Sorry for not describing the bug particularly. The bug is that I cannot close the Drawer when it is opened.

Is collapse set wrong, or is an older version of antd usedÔºü

I don't think so, because MenuDrawer and SettingDrawer still work correctly in the development environment. However, in the production environment, Drawers can't be closed when they're opened.

I don't know why this issue is close, I am using latest version pro-component with max plugin now, and I can not close Menu drawer on Mobile responsive by click on overlay

Did you solve your problem? If you didn't, you would set up an Ant Design Pro 5.0 with Umi version 3.x to solve this problem.
Because you said you used "max", you are using umi version 4.x and it causes that issue.
