# 🐛[BUG] "Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server"

I use pro-components in a Next.js app. When running in dev mode, I get a lot of warnings about `useLayoutEffect`:

```
Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server, because its effect cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format. This will lead to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this, useLayoutEffect should only be used in components that render exclusively on the client. See https://reactjs.org/link/uselayouteffect-ssr for common fixes.

```json

    "@ant-design/icons": "^4.8.0",
    "@ant-design/pro-list": "^2.0.40",

    "antd": "^5.1.0",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "next": "^13.1.0",

It doesn't seem like it leads to any issues, but maybe I'm wrong. And it would be nice to not have the warning.

忽略一下吧，这个没啥影响，ssr 比较容易碰到这个问题，一般是通过useLayoutEffect 替换为 useEffect 来绕过的
