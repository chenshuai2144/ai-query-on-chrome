"Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server" is a warning message from Next.js when using the `useLayoutEffect` hook in a component that is rendered on the server. This warning is caused by the fact that `useLayoutEffect` cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format, leading to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this warning, you should only use `useLayoutEffect` in components that render exclusively on the client.
