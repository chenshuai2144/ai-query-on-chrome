## luo3house

I guess there is an exception during publish, which caused an es import in cjs module. When I rebuild library, it outputs correctly.

## UnkAtreus

## jkiss

`SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` 心累。。。引入 antd的 `table`就没问题🤔

## raptoria

## alexneo2003

have same issue
my `Content` component contain `PageHeader` component imported from `@ant-design/pro-layout`
after changing root component import to `next/dynamic` issue was gone

```diff
- import Content from 'components/pages/Course/Content'
+ import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

+ const Content = dynamic(async () => await import('components/pages/Course/Content'), {
+  ssr: false,
+ })

function ContentPage() {
  return <Content />
}

export default ContentPage
```

what interesting - in my project i have 5 places where `PageHeader` was imported but only in one it throws error

From my part, I was able to solve this thanks to the response from @ogienma at https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/issues/4852#issuecomment-1364570216 in Next.js v13 with Ant Design v5.

The error message "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" typically occurs in a Next.js 13 project when you're trying to use an import statement in a file that is not recognized as a module. In Next.js 13, you need to use the `.js` extension for JavaScript files to be treated as modules.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure your file has the `.js` extension. For example, if your file is named `example.js`, rename it to `example.js`.

2. Ensure that the file is located in a directory recognized as a module. In Next.js, modules should be placed in the `pages` directory or any subdirectory inside the `pages` directory.

3. If you're trying to import a module from a different file, make sure the imported file also has the `.js` extension and is located in a module recognized directory.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" issue in Next.js 13.

```
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // es 模块编译
  transpilePackages: ['kitchen-flow-editor', '@ant-design/pro-editor', 'zustand', 'leva'],
```

you can use transpilePackages
