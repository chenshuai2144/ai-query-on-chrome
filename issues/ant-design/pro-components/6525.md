To resolve the "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" issue in Next.js 13, you can try adding the following code snippet to your `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // es 模块编译
  transpilePackages: [
    "kitchen-flow-editor",
    "@ant-design/pro-editor",
    "zustand",
    "leva",
  ],
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

This will enable es module transpilation for the specified packages, allowing you to import them from any file in your project. However, please note that enabling es module transpilation might affect other parts of your application, so make sure to test your application thoroughly after making changes to your configuration.
