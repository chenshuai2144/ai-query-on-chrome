To resolve the "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" issue in Next.js 13, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure your file has the `.js` extension. For example, if your file is named `example.js`, rename it to `example.js`.
2. Ensure that the file is located in a directory recognized as a module. In Next.js, modules should be placed in the `pages` directory or any subdirectory inside the `pages` directory.
3. If you're trying to import a module from a different file, make sure the imported file also has the `.js` extension and is located in a module recognized directory.
4. Use the `transpilePackages` option in your Next.js configuration to enable ES module compilation for certain packages. For example, you can use the following configuration to enable ES module compilation for the `@ant-design/pro-editor` package:

```yaml
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  // es 模块编译
  transpilePackages: ['kitchen-flow-editor', '@ant-design/pro-editor', 'zustand', 'leva'],
};
```
