To fix the issue of "Cannot use import statement outside a module" in `@ant-design/pro-components`, you can try transpiling the code with Babel. This can be done by adding the following to your `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  transpilePackages: ["@ant-design/pro-components"],
};
```

This will tell Babel to transpile the code for `@ant-design/pro-components` before it is executed, allowing you to use the import statement outside a module.
