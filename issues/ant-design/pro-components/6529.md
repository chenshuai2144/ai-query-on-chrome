Hi there! Thank you for reaching out to me. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the Thai translation is not working as expected in Ant Design's Table component. However, it is working in pull request #6535.

To diagnose this issue further, could you please provide more details on how the Thai translation is not working as expected? Also, could you please provide the version of Ant Design and any relevant code snippets you have?

In the meantime, I suggest checking the Ant Design documentation on internationalization configuration to see if there are any additional steps you may have missed: https://ant.design/docs/react/i18n.
