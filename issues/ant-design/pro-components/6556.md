The error message "findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode" means that you are trying to use `findDOMNode` function in a strict mode component. This is not allowed because `findDOMNode` is used for finding the root node of a React component tree, and strict mode components are intended to prevent side effects like accessing DOM elements from within them.
There are a few things you can do to fix this issue:

1. Avoid using `findDOMNode` inside strict mode components. If you need to access DOM elements from within a strict mode component, you should use other methods like `ReactDOM.findDOMNode`, `ReactDOM.querySelector`, or `React.createRef`.
2. Use React Hooks instead of classes. Hooks provide a way to define custom logic for state, lifecycle methods, and more without creating a class component. You can use the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the root node of your component tree and use that reference instead of `findDOMNode`.
3. Use the `shouldUpdate` method to conditionally update your component. If you don't need to update your component on every render, you can use `shouldUpdate` to determine whether to update based on some external state or other conditions.

I hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any other questions.
