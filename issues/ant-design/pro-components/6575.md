A bug was found in ProFormList when using ProFormDependency where data could not be obtained within an inner ProFormList. The issue was caused by incorrect nesting of ProFormList and ProFormDependency components. A solution is provided using useState hook to maintain data in ProFormList and set default values for ProFormDependency's dependencies. This allows for nested ProFormList components to work together and update accordingly.
