The user is having trouble with the ProFormDependency component in an Ant Design Pro Form List, and the issue is that it cannot access the inner data of the nested ProFormList. The solution is to use the useState hook to manage the data of the ProFormList and set the default value of the ProFormDependency as the data. This allows for nested ProFormList to be linked and updated together.
