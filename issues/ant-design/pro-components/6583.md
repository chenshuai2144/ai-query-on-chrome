It seems like there might still be an issue with the Ant Design Pro layout and its tokens. You mentioned that the menu items' colors were being overwritten when they are loaded dynamically into a page container that has the PageContainer component.
Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if there are any other CSS rules that might be conflicting with your Pro Layout tokens. You can use the browser's developer tools to inspect the element and see what styles are currently being applied to it.
2. Try setting the pro-layout.css import after importing the Ant Design Theme, so that it will take precedence over any other styles that may be overriding your Pro Layout tokens.
3. Verify that you have correctly configured your Pro Layout tokens according to the documentation. Make sure that the values you are using match the names and types specified in the documentation.
4. If none of these solutions work, you can try contacting Ant Design support for assistance. They may be able to help you resolve the issue or point you in the right direction.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
