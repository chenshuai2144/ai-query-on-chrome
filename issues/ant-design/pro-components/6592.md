This is a problem with the TypeScript version installed in your project and the version used by Visual Studio Code. You can try updating the TypeScript version used by VS Code to match the version in your project. To do this, you can go to `File` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings`, search for "typescript.version" and set it to the same value as your project's TypeScript version.
Another solution is to disable TypeScript checking in your project. To do this, you can add `"noErrorTruncation": true` to your `tsconfig.json` file.
If neither of these solutions work, you may want to check that all dependencies are properly installed and up-to-date. It's also possible that there may be an issue with the specific code or library you're trying to use. In this case, you may need to provide more information about your setup and the error message you're encountering.
