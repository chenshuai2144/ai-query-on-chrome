When using `renderFormItem` with `ProFormSelect` in a table, the selected item in the search bar displays values instead of labels. To fix this, set `fieldsProps.labelInValue = true`. However, this results in `[object, object]` instead of labels. The solution is to set `mode="combobox"` on the `ProFormSelect` component.
