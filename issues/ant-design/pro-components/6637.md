ProFormList does not suffer from the same issue because it does not use editable columns. Instead, it uses a list of form items that are rendered as rows in the table. This allows for more efficient rendering because the form items are only rendered when they are needed, rather than being rendered for every row in the table.
It is possible to implement a similar solution for EditableProTable, but it would require some additional work to make sure that the form items are only rendered when they are needed. One way to do this would be to use a virtualization library like React Virtualized to render only the visible rows in the table. This would allow for more efficient rendering and improve performance.
However, implementing this solution would require some additional work and may not be a straightforward task. If you are interested in contributing to the Ant Design Pro project, you can create a pull request to propose this solution.
