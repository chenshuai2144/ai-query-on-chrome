Thanks for the update! So as I understand, the issue is that in the mobile view, clicking on the center page does not close the sidebar, and this is not the expected behavior. Is that correct?

If so, you can solve this by adding an `onClick` handler to the center page that sets the `collapsed` state to `true`, which should close the sidebar.

Here's some sample code that should achieve that:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Layout, Menu } from "antd";

import "./styles.css";

const { Sider, Content } = Layout;

const App = () => {
  const [collapsed, setCollapsed] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Layout style={{ minHeight: "100vh" }}>
      <Sider
        collapsible
        collapsed={collapsed}
        onCollapse={() => setCollapsed(!collapsed)}
      >
        <Menu theme="dark" defaultSelectedKeys={["1"]} mode="inline">
          <Menu.Item key="1">
            <span>Option 1</span>
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item key="2">
            <span>Option 2</span>
          </Menu.Item>
        </Menu>
      </Sider>
      <Layout>
        <Content style={{ padding: "50px" }} onClick={() => setCollapsed(true)}>
          <div style={{ background: "#fff", minHeight: "100vh" }}>
            Hello World!
          </div>
        </Content>
      </Layout>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Here, I've added an `onClick` handler to the `Content` component, which represents the center page. This handler sets the `collapsed` state to `true`, which should close the sidebar.

Let me know if this helps or if you have any further questions!

Please kindly try the solution mentioned above, and see if it solves your problem.

Additionally, you may refer to the official documentation of [Ant Design Layout](https://ant.design/components/layout/) to learn more about how to use it. If you encounter any issues or have any further questions, feel free to ask!

@chenshuai2144 Thanks for your response

We are utilizing ProLayout from "@ant-design/pro-layout" instead of "antd". As the proposed solution pertains to "antd", do you have any alternative solution that is applicable to ProLayout from "@ant-design/pro-layout"?
