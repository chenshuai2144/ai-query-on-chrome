The problem of ConfigProvider setting the height of controls for ProFormText not working is caused by the theme settings being overridden. A possible solution is to override the style of ProFormText by adding a custom style in the App.tsx file. In the style file, define the height style for ProFormText. Another solution is to pass the style as a prop to ProFormText.
