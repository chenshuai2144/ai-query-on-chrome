Ant Design Pro v5 does not support the `ColorBgMenuItemSelected` variable, making it impossible to modify the color of selected menu items. To fix this, use the `theme` property in the `ConfigProvider` component or the `theme-color` property in the `style` attribute of the `ProLayout` component to define your theme color. These solutions only affect the selected menu item in the ProLayout, but to modify the color of the entire sidebar menu, CSS variables or the `theme` property in the `ConfigProvider` component are required.
