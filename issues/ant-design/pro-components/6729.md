# Slow performance when using many inputs in a form

### Reproduction link

[Codesandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/s/shi-yong-open-he-onopenchange-forked-y7qvf0?file=/App.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Try typing in one of the inputs in the comment column.

### Expected behavior

Writing should not cause latency or performance issues.

### Actual behavior

Typing is lagging and causing performance issues.

### Environment

- Ant Design: 5.3.0
- React: react
- System: Windows 10
- Browser: Chrome

### Workaround

Using `trigger: "onBlur" and valuePropName: "defaultValue"` can improve performance, but the input will no longer receive updates made directly to the form using `Form.setFieldValue`.

### Additional information

The issue is caused by the fact that all inputs are re-rendering on each keystroke, which should not happen.
