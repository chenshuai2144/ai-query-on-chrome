"Using many inputs in a form causes slow performance when typing. The issue can be resolved by using the `trigger: "onBlur" and valuePropName: "defaultValue"` workaround, but the input will no longer receive updates made directly to the form using `Form.setFieldValue`. The issue is caused by the re-rendering of all inputs on each keystroke, which should not happen."
