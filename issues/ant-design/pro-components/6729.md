# Form with many inputs are extremely slow

`AI Reply`

### Reproduction link

[![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/shi-yong-open-he-onopenchange-forked-y7qvf0?file=/App.tsx)

### Steps to reproduce

Try write anything in one of the inputs of comment column.

### What is expected?

Writing should not cause latency or performance issues.

### What is actually happening?

Typing is lagging, and causing performance issues.

| Environment | Info       |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| antd        | 5.3.0      |
| React       | react      |
| System      | Windows 10 |
| Browser     | Chrome     |

This uses EditableProTable from Pro-Components which is a wrapper around Ant Design. After some debugging I found that all inputs are re-rendering on each keystroke which shouldn't happen.
I found some workaround by using:

```typescript
trigger: "onBlur" and
valuePropName: "defaultValue"
```

This indeed improves things a bit but the input will no longer receive any update made directly to the form using Form.setFieldValue for example and in my use case I need to automatically display the price after choosing a product (and allowing it to be edited).
