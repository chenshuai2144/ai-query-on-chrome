A bug has been found in the latest version of Ant Design when upgrading from v5.2.20 to v5.3.0 or v5.3.1. The issue is that an argument appears to be a React component, but keys such as "forceAlign" and "forcePopupAlign" are missing. This error occurs when the project runs on both local and cloud environments. To resolve this issue, try deleting the node modules and reinstalling them. If the issue persists, consider using an older version of Ant Design.
