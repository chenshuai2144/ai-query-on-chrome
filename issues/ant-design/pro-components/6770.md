This issue is related to a bug in the `rc-resize-observer` library, which is used in the `antd` library. The bug causes the `elementRef.current` to be an empty object instead of a DOM element, which leads to a TypeError when trying to access the `forceAlign` and `forcePopupAlign` properties of the component. To fix the issue, you can try downgrading to an older version of `antd` or `rc-resize-observer`.
