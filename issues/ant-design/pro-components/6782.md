I apologize for the confusion. The solution I provided earlier was based on the assumption that the issue is caused by the PageContainer not adjusting its size properly on mobile screens. However, it's possible that the issue is caused by something else entirely.
To better understand the issue, could you provide more information about the specific behavior you are seeing on mobile screens? For example, are there any error messages or console logs? Are there any specific screen sizes where the issue occurs? Additionally, could you provide a screenshot or a minimal code snippet that reproduces the issue?
Once I have a better understanding of the issue, I can provide more specific guidance on how to fix it.
