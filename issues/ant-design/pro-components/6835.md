The problem is that the content of the page is overflowing the PageContainer on mobile screens. To fix this, you can add the CSS property `overflow-x: hidden` to the PageContainer wrapper. This will prevent horizontal scrolling on smaller screens and ensure that the content is always within the bounds of the container. Additionally, you can specify a `max-width` property for the PageContainer to limit the width on larger screens.
