The `<PageContainer>` component's content on mobile screens overflows beyond its container's boundaries. The expected behavior is for the content to be contained within the container's boundaries. To solve this issue, add the `overflow-x: hidden` property to the `<PageContainer>` component. This will prevent horizontal scrolling on smaller screens. An example implementation is provided with a specified `maxWidth`.
