To address the issue of automatic loading not being displayed on初次加载 the menu page in a prolayout generated project using Ant Design Pro, you can try setting the loading property of the ProLayout component to true in the entry file for the menu page.

Here's how:

1. Import the ProLayout component at the top of your file:

```
import ProLayout from '@ant-design/pro-layout';
```

2. Within the ProLayout component, set the loading prop to true to enable automatic loading when the page is initially rendered:

```
<ProLayout loading={true}>
  ...
</ProLayout>
```

3. If you need to toggle the loading state based on an asynchronous API call, you can use the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to update the loading state after the API has been fetched successfully:

```
import ProLayout from '@ant-design/pro-layout';

class MenuPage extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      loading: true,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Set the loading state to false once the API has been fetched successfully
        this.setState({ loading: false });
      });
  }

  render() {
    const { loading } = this.state;

    return (
      <ProLayout loading={loading}>
        ...
      </ProLayout>
    );
  }
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to enable automatic loading on the menu page in your Prolayout-generated project using Ant Design Pro.
