The issue of "process is not defined in pro-provider" has been reported and is still present in versions v16.20.0, npm 8.19.4, pro-components 2.4.4, and pro-provider 2.8.2. The problem is caused by the code in the pro-provider package, which uses `typeof process === 'undefined'` to check if `process` is defined. This approach is incorrect and should use `typeof process === 'undefined' || process.env.NODE_ENV?.toLowerCase() !== 'test'` instead. A temporary fix for this issue can be implemented using the vite or webpack plugin.
