# [Question] How to change the options of a table filter depending on another filters value

### Description

I have two filterable columns with valueType: `select`. I want the options of the second select to change when the selected option of the first filter changes.

### ðŸ’» Example Code

```typescript
{
    title: 'city',
    valueType: 'select',
    request: async () => {},
},
{
    title: 'district',
    valueType: 'select',
    request: async (form) => { // <- I know that doesn't exists but it would have been great to have such a feature
        return await getDistrictList(form.getFieldValue('city_id'))
    }
},
```

### ðŸš‘ Additional Information

This is not a feature request but is there a way to accomplish this without a custom implementation?
