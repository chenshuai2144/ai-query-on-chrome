# Pageheader is no longer maintaned?🧐

Hi guys, wanted to ask if **Pageheader** component is no longer maintaned, I'm using latest version with antd and ant pro, but seems the **extra** props in pageheaders dones't allow you to do _dropdowns_, but only _buttons_.

extra props support any reactnode , you can give a demo
