ProComponents version 2.4.4 and above have an issue with layout tokens, causing them to fail. This problem is present even after updating to version 2.4.12. The issue can be reproduced by using the latest version of Umi and Chrome. A solution to this issue involves updating to the latest version of ProComponents.
Update to the latest version of ProComponents.
Note that the official example for version 2.4.12 still has some tokens that do not work.

After updating to version 2.4.14, the issue was fixed again, but then it was accidentally corrected in a later version. It is recommended to use the previous version of ProComponents.
