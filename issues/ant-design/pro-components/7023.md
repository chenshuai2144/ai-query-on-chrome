# Bug: Customized Token Menu Font Color in Pro Layout not Working as Expected

Issue:

While customizing the header of the Layout component using the token API in app.tsx, I noticed that the `colorTextMenu` and `colorTextMenuSelected` properties are not being displayed as white, as expected.

Steps Taken:

- Setted `colorTextMenu` and `colorTextMenuSelected` properties.
- Used ProLayout's token API to customize various styles, including `colorBgHeader`, `colorHeaderTitle`, `colorTextMenu`, and `colorTextMenuSelected`.
- Required customizing the font color of the menuItem and the selected font color.

To better address this issue, please provide the following information:

- Actual ProComponents version number
- System version information (e.g., macOS, Windows, or Linux)
- Umi version number
- Browser environment
- Development environment
- Any other relevant information.
