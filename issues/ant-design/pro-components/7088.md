Hi there!

I understand that you're experiencing an issue with the `proTable` custom form component in version 2.4.15 where the `onchange` event is only triggered once for both input and select multiple scenarios. I'll try my best to help you with a solution.

To resolve this issue, you can try updating your `proTable` component to the latest version available. Make sure to follow the upgrade guide provided by the `proTable` documentation to ensure compatibility with your existing codebase.

If updating to the latest version doesn't resolve the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have correctly implemented the `onChange` event handler for your custom form component. Double-check if you're using it correctly and if it's correctly bound to the input/select elements.

2. Check if there are any specific props or configuration options that you need to set for the `proTable` component to enable proper triggering of the `onChange` event. Look for any documented examples or demos provided by the `proTable` documentation that showcase the usage of custom form components.

3. Examine your code to ensure that there are no other conflicting event handlers or code that might interfere with the `onChange` event. Sometimes, other event listeners or code can unintentionally prevent the `onChange` event from being triggered multiple times.

If the issue still persists after following these steps, you can try reaching out to the `proTable` GitHub repository for additional support. They may be able to provide more specific guidance or investigate if it's a bug in the library.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if you have any more specific information regarding your issue.
