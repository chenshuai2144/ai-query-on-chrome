This issue seems to be related to the usage of `useRefFunction` in `EditableProTable`. The error message indicates that `null` is being passed as an argument to the `useRef` hook, which may cause a `TypeError`.
It could be caused by several reasons such as:

- Incorrect import statement for `useRefFunction`
- Circular dependency or incorrect usage of `useRefFunction`
- Version compatibility issues between `@ant-design/pro-components` and other dependencies

It's recommended to check your code and ensure that all dependencies are correctly imported and in sync with each other. Additionally, you can try upgrading to the latest version of `@ant-design/pro-components` to see if the issue has been resolved. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your setup and any relevant code snippets so that we can assist you further.
