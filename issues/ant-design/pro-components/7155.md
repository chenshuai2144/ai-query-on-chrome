Bug report: An extra div is generated under the body when ProLayout's second-level menu is expanded and collapsed. It has been observed even in the official example. The expected result is no extra div being generated and the menu display not being affected by expansion and contraction. This issue has not been resolved and is still present in version 4.0.0 of ProComponents.
