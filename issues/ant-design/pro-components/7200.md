Bug in BetaSchemaForm causing columns fields to disappear on page refresh also occurs in ProTable. Reproduced code at https://github.com/xian107/proForm_bug, issue #7170 may be the same problem. Confirmed and needs to check together. However, this problem does not appear in the example of ProComponents component project, but appears in personal projects. Related issue is #7299.
