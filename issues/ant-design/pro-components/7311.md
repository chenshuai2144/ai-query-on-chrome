# Problem with ProCard

`AI Reply`

Is it possible to make the colSpan of ProCard work like colProps of ProFormInputText?

In other words, can we make it so that if I pass md = 12, the ProCard adjusts to 24 for smaller sizes and 12 for sizes equal to or larger than md?

Thank you for your question! It seems like you're trying to control the column span or width of ProCard component based on different screen sizes. However, the colSpan prop in ProCard is not designed to dynamically adjust its value based on screen sizes like the colProps in ProFormInputText.

To achieve the behavior you're describing, you can use the colProps prop of the ProCard.Grid component. The ProCard.Grid component allows you to define columns and their respective widths for different screen sizes. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { ProCard } from "your-react-library";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ProCard>
      <ProCard.Grid colSpan={{ xs: 24, sm: 12 }}>
        Content for smaller screens
      </ProCard.Grid>
      <ProCard.Grid colSpan={{ xs: 24, sm: 12 }}>
        Content for larger screens
      </ProCard.Grid>
    </ProCard>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In the example above, the first ProCard.Grid will have a column span of 24 for extra small (xs) screens, and 12 for small (sm) screens and larger. Similarly, the second ProCard.Grid will have a column span of 24 for extra small (xs) screens, and 12 for small (sm) screens and larger. You can adjust these values according to your specific requirements.

Please note that the specific syntax and usage may vary depending on the version of the ProCard component library you are using. It's always a good idea to consult the official documentation for the library you are using for more details and examples.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
