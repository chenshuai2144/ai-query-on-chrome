It appears that the current version of Umi does not automatically update the `dayjs.locale()` when the language changes, as expected. One potential solution could be to file a feature request for this functionality in the Umi repository. However, as the author of the original issue mentions, submitting a pull request may not guarantee that the feature will be implemented.

In the meantime, you can manually set the `dayjs.locale()` based on the selected language, similar to the previous suggestions. Alternatively, you could explore other options for internationalization in your application, such as using different libraries or techniques that better suit your needs.
