Hi there! It seems like you are facing an issue where the `dayjs.locale()` is not being affected when changing the language using the `SelectLang` component. To resolve this, you can follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have properly installed and imported the necessary dependencies. You need to have both `dayjs` and `dayjs/locale` packages installed.

   ```
   npm install dayjs
   npm install dayjs/locale
   ```

2. Import the required locales in your code. In your case, you need to import the 'en' and 'tr' locales:

   ```javascript
   import dayjs from "dayjs";
   import "dayjs/locale/en";
   import "dayjs/locale/tr";
   ```

3. Create a function that sets the locale based on the selected language. This function should be triggered when the language is changed. This can be achieved by adding an `onChange` event handler to your `SelectLang` component.

   ```javascript
   const handleLanguageChange = (selectedLanguage) => {
     if (selectedLanguage === "tr") {
       dayjs.locale("tr");
     } else {
       dayjs.locale("en");
     }
   };
   ```

4. Ensure that you are correctly passing the selected language value to the `handleLanguageChange` function.

   ```javascript
   <SelectLang onChange={handleLanguageChange} />
   ```

By following these steps, the `dayjs.locale()` should be affected when changing the language using the `SelectLang` component. Remember to include the necessary import statements and library installations.

You can find more information about `dayjs` and its locale customization in the official documentation:

- `dayjs` documentation: https://day.js.org/
- `dayjs` locale documentation: https://day.js.org/docs/en/i18n/i18n

I see, if you are using the `SelectLang` component provided by Umi and unable to change it, you can still manually change the `dayjs.locale()` based on the selected language. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the required dependencies and locales in your code:

```javascript
import dayjs from "dayjs";
import "dayjs/locale/en";
import "dayjs/locale/tr";
```

2. Create a function that sets the locale based on the selected language. This function should be triggered when the language is changed. You can use the existing `onChange` event handler of the `SelectLang` component.

```javascript
const handleLanguageChange = (selectedLanguage) => {
  if (selectedLanguage === "tr") {
    dayjs.locale("tr");
  } else {
    dayjs.locale("en");
  }
};
```

3. Make sure that you are passing the selected language value to the `handleLanguageChange` function within the `onChange` event handler of the `SelectLang` component. Please note that the actual implementation may vary based on your code structure.

```javascript
<SelectLang onChange={handleLanguageChange} />
```

With the above steps, you should be able to manually change the `dayjs.locale()` based on the selected language, even if you cannot modify the `SelectLang` component provided by Umi.

Remember to handle any other logic or state updates in your application that may be required when the language changes.

Yes, I am using this plugin already. The problem is having to manually change the language. In previous ant design pro versions, when the language was changed, the moment locale was also changed.
