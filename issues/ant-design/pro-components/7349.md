The issue you are facing is related to the `SelectLang` component provided by Umi, which is used to change the language of your application. If you are unable to change the language using the `SelectLang` component, you can manually change the `dayjs.locale()` based on the selected language. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the required dependencies and locales in your code:

```javascript
import dayjs from "dayjs";
import "dayjs/locale/en";
import "dayjs/locale/tr";
```

2. Create a function that sets the locale based on the selected language. This function should be triggered when the language is changed. You can use the existing `onChange` event handler of the `SelectLang` component.

```javascript
const handleLanguageChange = (selectedLanguage) => {
  if (selectedLanguage === "tr") {
    dayjs.locale("tr");
  } else {
    dayjs.locale("en");
  }
};
```

3. Make sure that you are passing the selected language value to the `handleLanguageChange` function within the `onChange` event handler of the `SelectLang` component. Please note that the actual implementation may vary based on your code structure.

```javascript
<SelectLang onChange={handleLanguageChange} />
```

With the above steps, you should be able to manually change the `dayjs.locale()` based on the selected language, even if you cannot modify the `SelectLang` component provided by Umi.

Remember to handle any other logic or state updates in your application that may be required when the language changes.
