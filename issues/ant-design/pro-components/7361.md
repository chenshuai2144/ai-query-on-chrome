Bug Description: The extra property of the Card component in version 2.6.3 caused the Checkbox only to work once and not work again after the first click.
Reproduction Steps: Reproduce the issue by visiting the following CodeSandbox: <https://codesandbox.io/s/ji-chu-qia-pian-forked-w9nyx5?file=/App.tsx>
Expected Result: The Checkbox should work consistently after each click.
重现代码: N/A
Version Information: ProComponents Version: [e.g. 4.0.0], Umi Version, Browser Environment, Development Environment (e.g. mac OS)
Fix for the Issue: This issue was fixed by commit c86532f which prevented the propagation of the onClick and onchange events through the element hierarchy.
Additional Information: A possible solution is to upgrade ProComponents to the latest version, which should resolve this issue. Alternatively, you can manually modify the code to add an onClick event listener that stops the propagation of the event by calling event.stopPropagation(). Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Card, Checkbox } from "antd";

const MyCard = () => {
  const handleCheckboxChange = (event) => {
    event.stopPropagation();
    // Handle checkbox logic here
  };

  return (
    <Card
      title="Card Title"
      extra={<Checkbox onChange={handleCheckboxChange}>Checkbox</Checkbox>}
    >
      <p>Card Content</p>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default MyCard;
```

This modification will ensure that the Checkbox works consistently after each click without propagating the events to parent elements.
