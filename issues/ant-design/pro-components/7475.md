### 🧐 问题描述

I' am customizing to search data while I' am using to protable.
whenever I' am using search box in my protable, I have to click the submit button on my mouse. I want it to submit my form on enter with button as well.
but I don't know how to add the key event in a submit button.
when using search form component, they've already setting the reset and submit button. so I want to add on ther event handler but I don't know where I can handle it.
currently, I'am customizing several search box to search in my table data. and I want to add on the enter key event in all search box .

I've used that Api that you've been knows me. but when I added on the api to use searcing the data putting like isKeyPressSubmit={true}, They operated event trigger, but I could not submit with parameter what I want to search it.
