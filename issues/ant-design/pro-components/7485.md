### 🧐 问题描述

I'm using the `ProCard` component inside of an Antd `ConfigProvider` with a theme that is in dark mode but for some reason the `ProCard` does appear to remain in the light mode.

Is there any setup i need to do to make it work?

you maybe install two version antd！

you can use `npm ls antd` look antd version

I only got one antd version:

```
PS C:\Users\A92615470\IdeaProjects\myproject> pnpm ls antd
Legend: production dependency, optional only, dev only

myproject@0.0.1 C:\Users\A92615470\IdeaProjects\myproject

dependencies:
antd 5.8.2
```

but i still run into that issue
