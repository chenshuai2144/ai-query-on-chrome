# Bug: `layout` set to `top`, menu background turns transparent when multiple-level routing menu is present

### Description

### Reproduction Steps

- Use the latest version of ant-design-pro
- Set `layout` to `top` in `defaultSettings.ts`
- Observe the background of the menu when multiple-level routing menus are present

### Expected Results

The background of the menu should be the same as the menu component.

### Code Reproduction

- Create a new project with the `umi` version of 4.0.52
- Run the project in a browser environment such as Chrome 115

### Discussion

- @chenshuai2144 : The background of the menu is not transparent, but it has become white or black depending on the default setting of antd.
- @dqrjz : The issue can be resolved by upgrading to the latest version of antd.
