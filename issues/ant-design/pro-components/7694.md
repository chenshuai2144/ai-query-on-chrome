Bug in `ProFormUploadButton` component's `onChange` event causing two identical info objects to be printed to console. Steps to reproduce:

1. Use the `ProFormUploadButton` component and configure an `onChange` event.
2. Select a file, and notice that the console prints two identical `info` objects.

Expected result: Only one `info` object should be printed after selecting a file.

Reproduction code can be found at <https://codesandbox.io/s/5rkg58?file=/App.tsx>. In the example, the upload button has an `onChange` callback function which is triggered every time a file is selected. However, the console prints two identical `info` objects.

Please note that this issue only occurs when using the latest version of ProComponents (4.0.0), Umi (4.17.11) and on Chrome and Firefox browsers. It does not happen in other environments or with older versions of these libraries.
