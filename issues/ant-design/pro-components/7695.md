This issue is about a bug in the `@ant-design/pro-layout` component where the `contentWidth` configuration is not being properly applied when set to `'Fluid'`. The problem seems to have been introduced in version `7.17.1` and persists in `7.17.2`.
The root cause of the issue appears to be in the following code snippet:

```javascript
if (contentWidth !== "Fluid") {
  const isWide = contentWidth === "Fixed"; // The reason maybe in changing this line
  const isWide = contentWidth === "Fixed" && value.layout === "top"; // updated line
  if (isWide) {
    return <SideBar width={value.width} />;
  }
}
```

When the `contentWidth` is set to `'Fluid'`, the code checks whether the current width matches that of the side bar. If it does not match, it returns the side bar component.
However, the issue lies in the fact that the side bar component's width is determined by the `width` property of the layout object passed as an argument to `GridContent`, rather than the `contentWidth` property itself. This means that even if the `contentWidth` is set to `'Fluid'`, the side bar component will still be displayed because its width is determined by the layout object.
To fix the issue, the code should check whether the `contentWidth` is set to `'Fluid'` and if so, use the width provided in the `layout` object to determine the width of the side bar component. Here's an example of how the code could be modified to achieve this:

```javascript
if (contentWidth !== "Fluid") {
  const isWide = contentWidth === "Fixed"; // The reason maybe in changing this line
  const isWide = contentWidth === "Fixed" && value.layout === "top"; // updated line
  if (isWide) {
    return <SideBar width={value.width} />;
  }
}
```

By checking for both the `contentWidth` and the `layout.width`, we can ensure that the side bar component is only displayed when the `contentWidth` is set to `'Fluid'` and the `layout.width` matches the desired width.
