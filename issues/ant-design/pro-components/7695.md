The `contentWidth: 'Fluid'` option in `@ant-design/pro-layout@7.17.1` is not working as expected. The issue is caused by a change in the `packages/layout/src/components/GridContent/index.tsx` file where the default value for `propsContentWidth` is `Fixed` instead of `Fluid`. To fix the issue, set `propsContentWidth` to `Fluid` in the `GridContent` component.
