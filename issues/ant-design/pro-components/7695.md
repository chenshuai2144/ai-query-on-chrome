# Bug Report: @ant-design/pro-layout@7.17.1 - contentWidth: 'Fluid' not working

## Description

When setting `contentWidth: 'Fluid'` in `app.tsx` with `@ant-design/pro-layout@7.17.1`, the layout is still limited to 1152px. This issue is caused by a change in the `packages/layout/src/components/GridContent/index.tsx` file, where the default value for `propsContentWidth` is `Fixed` instead of `Fluid`.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Install `@ant-design/pro-layout@7.17.1` and `@ant-design/pro-components@2.6.20`
2. Create a new project using `create-react-app`
3. In `app.tsx`, set `contentWidth: 'Fluid'`
4. Run the project

## Expected Result

The layout should be responsive and not limited to 1152px.

## Actual Result

The layout is still limited to 1152px.

## Version Information

- `@ant-design/pro-layout@7.17.1`
- `@ant-design/pro-components@2.6.20`
- Node.js v14.15.4
- React v17.0.2

## Additional Information

This issue was introduced in the `packages/layout/src/components/GridContent/index.tsx` file in commit `065524d` with the following changes:

- Fix(layout): default set contentWidth=Fixed. [065524d](https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/commit/065524d)
- const contentWidth = propsContentWidth ||value.contentWidth; // updated line

The previous version of the file, `packages/layout/src/components/GridContent/index.tsx` in commit `198469b`, did not have this issue and `contentWidth: 'Fluid'` worked as expected.
