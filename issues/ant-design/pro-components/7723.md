When using `Tab Pane` in `HeaderMenu` of ProTable 2.6.23, a "duplicate" error occurs. It can be reproduced by installing ProTable version 2.6.23 and including `Tab Pane` in `HeaderMenu`. The expected result is that the error should be resolved and the component should work correctly, but the actual result is that it causes a "duplicate" error. This issue was introduced in ProTable update to version 2.6.7 and can be tracked here: <https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/pull/7731>.
