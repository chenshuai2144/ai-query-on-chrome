This error message is indicating that there is a problem with the `react-dom` package. It seems that the package is not installed correctly or that there is a conflict with another package that is using the same version of `react-dom`.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Remove the `react-dom` package from your project by running the following command:

   css


    npm uninstall react-dom

2. Install the latest version of `react-dom` by running the following command:

   css


    npm install react-dom@latest

3. If the problem persists, try clearing your npm cache by running the following command:

   css


    npm cache clean --force

4. If the problem still persists, try reinstalling the entire `umi` package by running the following command:

   css


    npm install umi

5. If none of the above steps work, you may need to consult the umi documentation or seek help from the umi community on GitHub.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
