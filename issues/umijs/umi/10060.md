This feature request is for the umi4.x to support devServer, which allows for configuring headers such as 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' to allow the main application to access sub-applications cross-origin. One possible solution is to use the proxy option in the umi config or to add a middleware to the Express app that sets the headers.
