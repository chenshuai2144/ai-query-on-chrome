# Bug: Dynamic routing in patchClientRoutes does not render global layout

## What happens?

When running the application, the global layout is not rendered when components are rendered after dynamic routing is implemented using `patchClientRoutes`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Run the application
2. Observe that the global layout is missing from the rendered components
3. The expected behavior is that the global layout should be rendered along with the components after dynamic routing is implemented.

## Context

- Umi Version: "@umijs/max": "^4.0.39"
- Node Version: 19
- Platform: MacOS
