# Bug: monorepo formily less resolver error

- Minimal Reproduce Steps:

  - Have a monorepo project with a `work/console` directory containing an `antd` dependency
  - Use `umi` version `4.0.47` and `@umijs/bundler-webpack` version `4.0.47`
  - Run the project and observe the error message

- Error message:

  - "Webpack resolver error details: resolve '~antd/lib/modal/style/index.less' in 'work/console/src' Parsed request is a module using description file: work/console/package.json (relative path: ./src) using description file: work/console/package.json (relative path: ./src/~antd/lib/modal/style/index.less) no extension work/console/src/~antd/lib/modal/style/index.less doesn't exist .less work/console/src/~antd/lib/modal/style/index.less.less doesn't exist .css work/console/src/~antd/lib/modal/style/index.less.css doesn't exist as directory work/console/src/~antd/lib/modal/style/index.less doesn't exist resolve as module"

- Dependencies:

  - @umijs/max@4.0.47
  - @umijs/bundler-webpack@4.0.47
  - Antd version: 5.x

- Suggested solution: Upgrade `umi` dependency to the latest version, or降级项目中的 `antd` 依赖版本到 4, and make sure there is only one instance of `antd` in the global environment.
