# Umi Report

This tool provides data on PR and issue counts, npm downloads and usage, contributor and start/fork/watch ranges, and version releases. It also allows for the ranking of PRs and issues, tracking growth over time, and generating an MD file with the data.

Users can run the report with custom start and end times (，默认为去年). The tool also has a development feature that enables users to add plugins similar to `umi run`. This report is based on suggestions from @sorrycc and Cloud谦老师.
