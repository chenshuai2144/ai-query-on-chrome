# Bug: Dev Dependencies in umi v4 upgrade guide are incorrect

The official documentation for upgrading from umi v3 to v4 has an incorrect dependency list in the "devDependencies" section. Specifically, the "umi" dependency is listed twice, once at version "^3.0.0" and once at version "^4.0.0". This can cause issues when upgrading, as the "^3.0.0" version will be installed in the "dependencies" section, while the "^4.0.0" version will be installed in the "devDependencies" section.
To resolve this issue, the dependency list should be updated to remove the duplicate "umi" entry at version "^3.0.0" and include only the "^4.0.0" version.
Please provide a minimal reproduction repository for this issue, as well as the expected behavior and any relevant configuration.
