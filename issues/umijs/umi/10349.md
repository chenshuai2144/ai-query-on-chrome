The umi v4 upgrade guide has an incorrect devDependencies list, with the "umi" dependency listed twice. This can cause issues during upgrades and should be updated to remove the duplicate entry at version "^3.0.0" and include only the "^4.0.0" version. A reproduction repository and relevant configuration are needed for further investigation.
