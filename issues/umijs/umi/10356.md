When using `@umijs/deps@3.5.36` and `browserslist@4.17.5`, the `require.resolve` keyword in the compiled `babel/bundle.js` file returns an empty module. This issue can be reproduced by cloning the repository `umi-browserslist-extends-bug-sample`, installing dependencies, and starting the development server. The expected behavior is for the application to run without errors. The affected versions are Umi 3.5.36, Node 16.14.2, and Browserslist 4.17.5 on macOS.
