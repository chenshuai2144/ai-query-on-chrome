# Feature Request: plugin-locale should merge extraLocales(antd, momentLocale) when addLocale

When adding locales, manually calling addLocale, the current logic is as follows:
https://github.com/umijs/umi/blob/55d6adf4b9d8949ca507a8d329920dedbf70ec25/packages/plugins/libs/locale/localeExports.tpl#L89-L100
Message can be merged, but Antd cannot be merged, which is very inconvenient.
Proposal: Consider merging like message.

antd needs to merge what content? Not very clear about the problem, can you give an example, now you are encountering problems?

## rozbo

For example, when the server also has a zh-CN language configuration, but if you call addLocale at this time, but the server does not have momentLocale, antd, these additional configurations, the configuration will be lost.

I think it's better to merge like message.
