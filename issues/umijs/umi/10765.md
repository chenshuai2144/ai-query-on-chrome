When using `mpa` mode with UMI v4 in local development, an error occurs when trying to import React. The error message "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useEffect')" appears when visiting <http://localhost:8000/docs.html>. To resolve this issue, try disabling `mpa` in the dev environment or modify the `mfsu` configuration to include the `react-dom/client` module. This is necessary because the project's entry point does not reach `<src>.umi/mpa/docs.tsx`, so its dependencies (such as `react-dom`) are not analyzed by `mfsu`.
