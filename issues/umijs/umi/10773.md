# Bug: `api.onStart()` executed multiple times during plugin development

During plugin development, `api.onStart()` was executed multiple times, despite only being expected to be executed once. This occurred in the mfsu environment, where the function was executed once in another thread and did not need to be concerned about the second print. If it affects visibility, it can be turned off first during development by setting `mfsu: false`.
