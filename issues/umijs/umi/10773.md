# Bug: api.onStart() executed multiple times during plugin development

## Background

During plugin development, it was discovered that the `api.onStart()` function was executed multiple times, despite only being expected to be executed once.

## Reproduction

```ts
// plugin.ts
import { IApi } from "umi";

export default (api: IApi) => {
  api.onStart(() => {
    console.log("Local Plugin");
  });
};
```

## Environment

- **Umi Version**: v4.0.61
- **Node Version**: v16.15.0
- **Platform**: MacBook Pro

## Solution

In the mfsu environment, the function will be executed once, which is another thread and does not need to be concerned about the second print. If it affects visibility, it can be turned off first during development by setting `mfsu: false`.
