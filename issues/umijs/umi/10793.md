When using ant design pro components, a warning message appears: "Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <a> cannot appear as a descendant of <a>." To reproduce the warning, visit <https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components> and follow the steps to install and run the project. Expected behavior is for the project to run without errors or warnings. The issue can be fixed by upgrading ant design pro components to version 2.4.3 or later. This applies to Umi Version 4.0.61, Node Version 16.13.1, and macOS.
