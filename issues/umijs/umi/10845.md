# Bug: Umi 4 not producing expected splitChunks results

## Steps to reproduce

1. Configure splitChunks in Umi 4 using the following code:

```javascript
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    minSize: 30000,
    minChunks: 3,
    automaticNameDelimiter: '.',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        name: 'vendors',
        test({ resource }: any) {
          return /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/.test(resource);
        },
        priority: 10,
      },
    },
  },
},
```

2. Observe that chunks with a size less than 3 times will not be included in the vendors chunk.
3. Attempt to access the htmlChunks property of Umi 4, which returns an array containing the vendors and umi chunks.
4. Observe that the chunksToFiles function returns an error due to the missing vendors chunk.

## Expected behavior

1. The vendors chunk should be included in the splitChunks results.
2. The htmlChunks property should return an array containing the vendors and umi chunks.
3. The chunksToFiles function should not return an error.

## Actual behavior

1. The vendors chunk is not included in the splitChunks results.
2. The htmlChunks property returns an array containing the vendors and umi chunks.
3. The chunksToFiles function returns an error due to the missing vendors chunk.

## Potential solution

1. Check the configuration of the splitChunks option to ensure that it is correctly configured.
2. Verify that the vendors chunk is being included in the splitChunks results.
3. Ensure that the htmlChunks property is returning the expected array.
4. Address the error in the chunksToFiles function by providing the vendors chunk.
