# Bug: Umi 4 not producing expected splitChunks results

Steps to reproduce:

- Configure splitChunks in Umi 4
- Observe that chunks with a size less than 3 times will not be included in the vendors chunk
- Attempt to access the htmlChunks property of Umi 4
- Observe that the chunksToFiles function returns an error due to the missing vendors chunk

Expected behavior:

- The vendors chunk should be included in the splitChunks results
- The htmlChunks property should return an array containing the vendors and umi chunks
- The chunksToFiles function should not return an error

Actual behavior:

- The vendors chunk is not included in the splitChunks results
- The htmlChunks property returns an array containing the vendors and umi chunks
- The chunksToFiles function returns an error due to the missing vendors chunk

Potential solution:

- Check the configuration of the splitChunks option
- Verify that the vendors chunk is being included in the splitChunks results
- Ensure that the htmlChunks property is returning the expected array
- Address the error in the chunksToFiles function by providing the vendors chunk.
