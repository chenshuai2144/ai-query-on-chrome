# Wondering your thoughts on the future of UmiJS? About the latest NextJS developments of React.

Hi, I like using UmiJS, it has a clean hierarchy and a neat code flow. I'm wondering what your thoughts are about create-next-app, which has been keeping the frontend industry busy lately. UmiJS is not popular and well known in my area, I find it difficult to describe the advantages of UmiJS while the industry is generally leaning towards NextJS.
