# Bug: Unocss generation exception in 4.0.66 version

After upgrading @umijs/max and @umijs/plugins to version 4.0.66, the generated CSS code in the src/.umi/uno.css file is incomplete, missing custom transformers, rules, presetWind, and presetWind specified in the unocss.config.ts file. Switching to version 4.0.62 returns to normal.
