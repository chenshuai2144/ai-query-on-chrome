# Error: UseBuiltIns usage configuration error with @umijs/mfsu in webpack5

When using webpack5 and @umijs/mfsu together, a "TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined" error occurs during runtime. This error arises due to an attempt by getBabelPlugins() function from @umijs/mfsu to access the Array.prototype.call method on an undefined object. A minimal working example is provided to demonstrate this issue.
