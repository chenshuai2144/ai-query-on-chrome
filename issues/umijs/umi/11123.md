# Bug: `Connect` component prevents external access to props

## Description:

Using the `connect` decorator causes props to become unidentifiable and inaccessible from outside of the component.

## Reproduction:

Please provide configuration and reproduction steps.

## Context:

- Umi version: @umijs/max
- Node version: v16.14.2
- Platform: Mac
- Issues related to Dva compatibility. Dva has not been updated in a long time, so it doesn't support TypeScript type inference for props, making them unavailable for external access. Consider using modern data flow libraries like react-query and valtio or jotai to handle requests and global data.
