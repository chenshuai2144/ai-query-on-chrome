Access function in `access.ts` fails to return complete route path for certain pages, causing issues with user access permissions determination. Solution includes either adding full route path to access function or using alternative attributes or additional identifier keys. Issue does not affect projects using Umi3 or earlier versions of UmiJS@Max.
