# Bug: Access function in access.ts file returns incomplete route path

In the access.ts file, the returned route address is only half of the original, for example, the address of a page is /business/repayment, but in the function for page permission judgment, it returns repayment, which makes it impossible to determine if the user has the permission for this page. (Cannot use half judgment method)
In umi3, there is no such problem. In previous umi3 projects, there is no such problem. In umijs@max, there is a problem.
In the umi3 project, the route is written in a tree-like manner, and the function for page permission judgment returns the complete path. In umijs@max, the route is written in a half manner, and the function for page permission judgment returns an incomplete path.

The original path is passed directly, if the judgment basis is insufficient, you can use other properties to judge or add other identification keys, which will also be passed.
