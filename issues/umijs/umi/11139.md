# Bug: In access.ts file, incomplete route path returned for page permission judgment

In umi3 and previous projects, the route path is written in a tree-like manner and the function returns the complete path. However, in umijs@max, the route is written in a half manner and the function returns an incomplete path, making it impossible to determine if the user has permission for the page. To solve this, you can pass the original path directly and use other properties or identification keys for insufficient judgment basis.
