# Feature Request: Support ant 5.0 dynamic theme response in request.ts

## Problem

The `request.ts` file uses the `errorHandler` and displays an ant5 notification, but it cannot use ant5's dynamic theme response.

## Solution

Update to the latest version and try again. This PR seems to have solved the problem.
Link: <https://github.com/umijs/umi/pull/11176>

## Relevance

Always use the latest version, not yesterday's version.

## Failure to Reproduce

After updating to the latest version, the problem still persists.

## Additional Information

The problem can be solved by enabling the app configuration in the configuration. This has been the case for several versions before.
