"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')" when importing a package with `type=module` format in Node.js 16.4.2 on macOS 11.4. Solution involves adding the package to the `extraBabelIncludes` list in the UMI configuration file but only a temporary fix as it doesn't resolve the root cause. Other modules requiring `type=module` packages may face similar issues when integrated with UMI.
