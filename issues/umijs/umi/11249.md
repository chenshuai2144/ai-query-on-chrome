"Pnpm 8.6.0 installs multiple AntD versions causing errors. Reproduce by installing v8.6.0 and running 'pnpm install'. Minimal reproduction repo available upon reproduction. Solution is to remove the 'antd' dependency from the 'umi-max' package.json file or add an alias for '@ant-design/react' to match the version specified in your 'package.json' file."
