UMI 3's access configuration doesn't prevent unauthorized page access. The 'notnew' and 'new' switch controls old and new features, respectively. The initial switch state is false, but users can still access pages requiring the 'new' switch when it's off. This contradicts the documented behavior of showing a rendering error page instead of granting access. Affected versions include 3.x on Node.js 14.18.0 using Chrome.
