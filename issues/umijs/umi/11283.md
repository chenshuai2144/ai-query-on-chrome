# Bug: Access configuration not blocking unauthorized pages

## What happens?

A set of mutually exclusive switches `new` and `old` are used to switch between new and old features. When `old` is enabled, `enableOldSettlement` is set to `true` by default, which is `false`. When `new` is enabled, `enableOldSettlement` is set to `false`.

## Mini Showcase Repository (REQUIRED)

When `new` is enabled, it is still possible to access unauthorized pages through the `/old` route. For example, when `access` is set to `new`, the user can still access the old page.

## Context

- **Umi Version**: 3.x
- **Node Version**: 14.18.0
- **Platform**: Chrome
- **FZ6M**: Umi 3 is no longer maintained, and it is recommended to upgrade to Umi 4.
