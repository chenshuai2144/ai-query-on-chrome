UMI 4.0.17 fails to create a new project when a workspace is not present in the lockfile, even when using yarn as the npm client and registry. The expected behavior is for the project to be created successfully, but instead, an internal error occurs with the message "This package doesn't seem to be present in your lockfile; run "yarn install" to update the lockfile." This issue can occur on both MacOS and Linux.
