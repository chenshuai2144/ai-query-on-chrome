# Bug in App 2 when using both MF & Locale

When using Max's Multi-Framework (MF) plugin and locale configuration in two different apps, App 2 fails to render components that use the `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library. The error occurs because the `useIntl` hook is being imported directly from `@umijs/max`, which includes it in all projects where it is used, even if it's not needed. To fix the issue, change the way you import `useIntl` so that it's only included in the project where it's used.
