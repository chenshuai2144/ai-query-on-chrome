UMI 3's `runtimePublicPath` option does not correctly update the async static file path when using a different value for `window.publicPath`. This can cause issues when requesting async static files through a different URL than `/public/`.
To fix this problem, please provide a minimal reproduction of the issue and upload it to your GitHub. Then follow these steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Set `window.publicPath` to a different value.
2. Request an async static file through a URL that uses the new `window.publicPath` value.

Expected behavior: The requested async static file should be returned successfully.
Context: UMI version, Node version, platform (fz6m, siadou, etc.), and whether you're using UMI 3 or UMI 4.
