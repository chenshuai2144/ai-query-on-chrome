# Bug in umi@4: Cannot use request configuration without max

When you add the following code to src/app.tsx:

```typescript
export const request = {
  timeout: 1000,
  // other axios options you want
  errorConfig: {
    errorHandler: {},
    errorThrower: {},
  },
  requestInterceptors: [],
  responseInterceptors: [],
};
```

You will receive an error:

```bash
Unhandled Rejection (Error): register failed, invalid key request from plugin
```

umi@4 does not come with any additional plugins by default. Max is a feature that allows you to use umi@4 with pre-installed plugins. If you want to use umi@4 without max, you can use the following method:

1. Install the `@umijs/plugins` package using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm i -D @umijs/plugins
```

2. Add the following code to your `.umirc.ts` file:

```typescript
export default {
  plugins: ["@umijs/plugins/dist/request"],
  request: {},
};
```
