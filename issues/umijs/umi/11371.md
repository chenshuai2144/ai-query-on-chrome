MFSU does not support importing packages with `/_ webpackIgnore: true _/` and this can cause an error during build with the message "AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: [MFSU] package.json not found". To reproduce, open MFSU and try importing a package with the `/_ webpackIgnore: true _/` syntax. This issue occurs with Umi version @umijs/core@3.5.20 and Node version 16.20.0 on the web platform.
