When using `umi` version `4.0.72` and the `extraBabelIncludes` option in a monorepo project, setting `mfsu` to `true` and `extraBabelIncludes` to `[/@km-r/]` results in no hot update and the component with the `@km-r/home-block` dependency not being compiled. Setting `mfsu` to `false` resolves the issue.
