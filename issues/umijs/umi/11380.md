# Bug: `mfsu` and `extraBabelIncludes` not working together in development mode

In a monorepo project, I'm trying to compile and parse components that depend on `@km-r/home-block`. To achieve this, I'm using the `umi` package version `4.0.72` and the `extraBabelIncludes` option in the `umi.config.js` file.

Here's my `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "umi": "^4.0.72",
    "@km-r/home-block": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

And my `umi.config.js` file:

```javascript
{
  mfsu: {
    esbuild: true,
  },
  extraBabelIncludes: [/@km-r/],
}
```

However, the `extraBabelIncludes` option is not working as expected. There is no hot update, and the component with the `@km-r/home-block` dependency is not being compiled.

If I set `mfsu` to `false`, everything works as expected.
