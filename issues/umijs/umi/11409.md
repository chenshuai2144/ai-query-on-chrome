# Bug: getInitialState not working in runtime configuration

`getInitialState` does not execute when passed as an argument to `defineApp`. It works as expected when exported independently. To fix this issue, use `export const getInitialState` instead of using it in `defineApp`. A related PR #9708 has been created to address this issue.
