# Bug: getInitialState not working in runtime configuration

## What happens?

When `getInitialState` is passed as an argument to `defineApp`, it does not execute.

- `getInitialState` is not executed when defined in `defineApp`

- `getInitialState` works as expected when exported independently

## Solution

This is a known issue, and `getInitialState` is special in that it can only be exported independently. Use `export const getInitialState` instead of using it in `defineApp`. A related PR #9708 has been created to address this issue.
