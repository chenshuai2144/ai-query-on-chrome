A bug occurs when using the `@import` statement for Antd v5's CSS-in-JS theme with Umi v5. This results in an error when running the project on Node.js. The minimal showcase repository can be found here: <https://github.com/fz6m/umi-issue-antd-path-error>. Steps to reproduce the issue include installing Umi v5 and Antd v5, adding the reference path, and running the project locally. The expected behavior is for the project to run without any errors related to the missing module path. The solution provided by @fz6m using v4 Antd and upgrading to v5 Umi plugin does not address the original issue.
