# Node Modules Path Error with Antd v5

When adding a reference path to `@import 'antd/lib/style/themes/default.less';` in your code, you may encounter a path error if it is not in the node modules path. This issue can be resolved by upgrading to antd v4 or enabling the umi v4 antd plugin and removing the `.less` import.
