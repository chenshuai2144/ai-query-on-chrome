Bug in routes configuration causing redirect loop. Due to layout displaying breadcrumbs, clicking on 'Documents' redirects to '/docs'. Expected redirect to '/docs/list' after configuring 'redirect:/docs/list' in child route. Minimal reproduction repository required. yarn install, start development without yarn dev: test, click on 'Documents' to reproduce issue. Steps to reproduce not provided. Umi version: "@umijs/max": "^4.0.72", Node version: 18.16.0 Platform: Chrome. Bug in nested routes where parent route cannot configure 'redirect' causing redirection through parent route on entering any nested sub-route. Need to split routes and reference routes table from antd-pro. If routes table returned by backend, need to create it this way in backend.
