"Bug" in umi4 causes multiple page tabs to not display properly when there are too many, and the tab bar width does not adapt accordingly. It would be helpful to have a feature that allows users to close the current page tab. Additionally, when switching to the black theme, the background color of the tab bar remains unchanged. These issues may be related to Pro's settings not being dynamically rendered for multi-page tabs. Please refer to the official documentation for more information on how to resolve these issues.
