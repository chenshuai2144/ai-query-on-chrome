# Bug: sandboxing in qiankun causes overrides.less to fail

## Symptoms:

Styles in overrides.less are no longer effective when qiankun is in sandbox mode. To improve compatibility, styles should be placed under #root.

## Solution:

If you have specific requirements, write a postcss plugin to handle it. Refer to <https://github.com/umijs/umi/blob/master/packages/preset-umi/src/features/overrides/overrides.ts> for reference.
