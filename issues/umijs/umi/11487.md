Bug: When using qiankun's sandbox feature, styles defined in `overrides.less` for child applications don't work as expected. The recommended solution is to place styles within the `#root` element or create a custom PostCSS plugin to handle this issue. An example can be found at <https://github.com/umijs/umi/blob/master/packages/preset-umi/src/features/overrides/overrides.ts>.
