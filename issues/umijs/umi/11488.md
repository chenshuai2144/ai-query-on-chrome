# Feature Request: How to configure webpack's showEslintErrorsInOverlay property in umi4

## Background

When the showEslintErrorsInOverlay property is enabled in umi4, and some eslint rules are set, such as unused variables, the page will report an error, indicating the eslint rule, and achieving a similar effect to the following:

## Proposal

Currently, I am modifying the chainWebpack, but this setting is not correct. I request an answer on how to set it up.

```javascript
  chainWebpack(memo, { env, webpack }) {
    memo.showEslintErrorsInOverlay.set(true);
  },
```
