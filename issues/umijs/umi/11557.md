# Bug: setLocale not working after disabling third-party cookies

When third-party cookies are disabled, it is not possible to set the current locale through `setLocale`. Instead, a different method, such as changing the URL, must be used to set the default language. After setting the locale through `setLocale`, refreshing the page does not update the locale in react-intl. A minimal reproduction repository is required to provide a clear and concise description of the issue.
