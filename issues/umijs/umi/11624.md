# Bug Report: Icon Not Working in Local Use and Dynamic Routing

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Import the Icon component using `import { Icon } from 'umi'`.
2. Use the Icon component within your components.

### Symptoms:

Following the documentation, the Icon is not showing up. Additionally, it does not display properly on dynamic routing pages.

### Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE):

To help reproduce the issue, we have created a repository with a basic React project that demonstrates the problem. Visit <https://github.com/LukerSpringtree/umi-icon-dynamicroute-bug> and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run start`.

Once the server is running, you can access the static pages at `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/another-page` to verify that the issue can be reproduced.

### Specific Problem:

- The Icon displays correctly on non-dynamic routing pages.
- On dynamic routing pages, the Icon does not work due to the missing `.tsx` files for the current path being overlooked by the Symbol Maker.

### Solution:

A potential solution is to manually call the `addPrepareBuildPlugins()` method when encountering dynamic routes. Update your code as follows:

```javascript
function addPrepareBuildPlugins() {
  const plugins = [
    new UmiPlugin({
      prepareWebpackConfig(config) {
        // Add plugin
        config.optimization.plugins.push(
          new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
            filename: "[name].[contenthash].css",
          }),
        );
      },
    }),
  ];
  return plugins;
}
module.exports = {
  ...defaultConfig,
  build: {
    ...defaultConfig.build,
    plugins: addPrepareBuildPlugins(),
  },
};
```

Add this code snippet to your project and it should resolve the issue of the Icon not displaying on dynamic routing pages.
