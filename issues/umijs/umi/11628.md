To fix #Bug, use "@umijs/max" instead of "umi" when importing the Icon component in your umi config files. If you want more icons, manually add them to the icons array in your config file or import individual icons for each dynamic route. Manual imports may require additional maintenance, but provide more flexibility and control over available icons.
