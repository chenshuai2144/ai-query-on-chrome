Bug in UMI 4's Dynamic Base Routing: Removing `base` setting from HTML files after upgrading from UMI 3 to UMI getMax version. To solve, add `base` value directly in HTML file or use `.umirc.ts` to inject necessary code. Use runtime configuration plugins for modifying client render options. Set `runtimePublicPath` and add `window.publicPath = ...` in the runtime configuration file to dynamically add `publicPath`. Patch `h.push` and `h.replace` methods in React Router v6 to dynamically add `base` to `push` and `replace` methods. Add `base` to the `push` and `replace` methods of the `history` object by adding the code snippet to the `modifyClientRenderOpts` function.
