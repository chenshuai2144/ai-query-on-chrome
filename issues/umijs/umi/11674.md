"Feature Request: Allow each page to have its own separate multi-language file, loaded through a namespace. Background: Large multi-language files make it difficult to manage. Proposal: Create separate files for each page in the `locale` directory, such as `home.json` and `settings.json`, and load them through a namespace similar to `next-i18n`. This would allow for more efficient use of resources and better management of translations. Note: Umi is a React-based SPA framework that is not recommended for performance or size-sensitive C端或手机端 pages."
