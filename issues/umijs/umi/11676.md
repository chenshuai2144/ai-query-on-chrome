# Problem: Configuring `base` in `config.local.ts` causes duplicate routes

When `base` is set to `/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/` in `config.local.ts`, visiting `http://localhost:4118/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/booking` redirects to `http://localhost:4118/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/booking`, displaying a warning message that no routes match the location `/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/booking`.

## Reproduction steps

1. Clone the reproduction repository: <https://github.com/fz6m/umi-base-duplicate-routes.git>
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Visit `http://localhost:4118/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/booking` in the browser.

## Minimal Showcase Repository

The reproduction repository includes two configuration files:

- `config.local.ts`: sets the `base` configuration to `/aaaaaaaaaaaaa/`
- `config.ts`: has no `base` configuration

Note: You can modify these configurations according to your needs.
