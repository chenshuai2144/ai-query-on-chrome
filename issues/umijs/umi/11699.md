# Error in Umi 4.0.48 with React Router

Using `history.push` with a state object that has a function as a property leads to `useLocation()` not being able to retrieve the state. This is reproducible in Umi version 4.0.48 on Node v16 on Mac. To reproduce, go to '/demo/list-data/detail' page and try to access the state property using `useLocation()`. The expected behavior is that the state property containing the function should be returned by `useLocation()`.
