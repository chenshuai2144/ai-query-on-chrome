Request to remove hash from remote.js file for modules fed by MF. Background: To prevent caching, need to set hash parameter to true; discovered remote.js file also receives a hash suffix when using MF, making it difficult to use as stable URL. Proposed Solution: Add option to MF config to control adding hash to remote.js file; allows users to opt-out of hash behavior. Risks: Without hash, initial and async loads may not be done at same time during pub; module ID & actual module may mismatch due to tree shaking, leading to different code being loaded.
