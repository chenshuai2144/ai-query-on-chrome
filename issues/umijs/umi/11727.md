The `config.srcTranspiler` option in Umi doesn't currently support "none" and setting it to that value will result in an error when building with $ pnpm max build. The implementation in packages/bundler-webpack/src/config/javaScriptRules.ts doesn't support this option at the moment. To avoid this error, it's recommended not to use "none" as a value for config.srcTranspiler, but instead set it to undefined if you want to disable transpilation altogether.
