UMI v3 has an issue where a route with "@@" symbol in its path, e.g., "@@/plugin-AA/layout", is incorrectely converted to "/Users/xxx/Documents/project/xxx/src/pages//Users/xxx/Documents/project/xxx/src/.umi/plugin-AA/layout". This occurs in both initial route configuration and after running "umi setup" command. Steps to reproduce include creating a new UMI project, adding a page, and configuring a route with "@@" symbol in it. This issue only occurs with this specific symbol and not other symbols like "/", "@", etc. The environment details provided are for version 3.5.37 of UMI, node v16.18.0, macOS 13.0.1, and OS X Monterey. Additional information suggests this issue may be related to how Route.js and ui/utils.js handle paths containing "@@" symbol.
