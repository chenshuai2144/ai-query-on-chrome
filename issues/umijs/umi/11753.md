Bug report: A fix for UMI 10557 causes sub-apps to flash on load. Steps to reproduce:

- Load a page with sub-apps
- Notice the flashing effect.
  Expected behavior: Sub-apps should load smoothly without any flashing. Context: UMI version: X.X.X Node version: Y.Y.Y Platform: Mac/Linux/Windows If you don't want to configure menus, you can define a component for certain routes in your application, and use `<MicroApp>` to render whatever you want inside the component. However, `<MicroApp />` cannot be displayed correctly. Use `<MicroAppWithMemoHistory />` instead.
