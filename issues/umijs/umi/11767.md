# Problem:

When creating a new UMI Simple App project and importing components from libraries such as Ant Design, Ant Mobile or Dingtalk Design Mobile, the page components will not render properly and error messages will be displayed.
Error messages include:

- "Invalid hook call": React version and renderer version mismatch, possibly due to multiple React libraries or Hooks being used in the project.
- "UseContext is invalid hook call": UseContext Hook can only be called in functional components, potentially caused by a mismatch between React versions and renderers.
- "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')": A null pointer exception may occur due to a mismatch between React versions and renderers, or because there is an error in the code.

## Reproduction Repository:

To reproduce the problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Install necessary dependencies with npm:

   javascript


    npm install antd @ant-design/react mobile dingtalk-design-mobile

2. Create a new UMI Simple App project:

   javascript


    umi create my-app

3. Change into the project directory:

   javascript


    cd my-app

4. Initialize Docusaurus documentation site:

   javascript


    yarn docusaurus init -p theme-alabaster

5. Replace Docusaurus template with simple style:

   bash


    rm -rf src/theme
    cp -r node_modules/@umijs/docusaurus-theme-simpla/dist src/theme

6. Add business code to src/pages/index.js file:

   javascript


    touch src/pages/index.js

7. Import required components in src/pages/index.js:

   javascript


    import { Button } from 'dingtalk-design-mobile'

8. Export homepage component:

   javascript


    export default function HomePage() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>test</h1>
          <p><Button>test</Button></p>
        </div>
      );
    }

## How to Reproduce:

Follow the above steps to create a new UMI Simple App project and import components from libraries, then observe if the page components display correctly.
