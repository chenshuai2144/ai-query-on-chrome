# [Feature Request] provide an option to disable error overlay

`wontfix`

I'm trying to capture the error in the error boundary, and don't want error overlay to show, is there any way to disable the error boundary?

## sorrycc

Which error overlay?

It's a runtime error, why do you want to disable it?

@sorrycc what if we don't disable it but catch the error? It seems the exception is captured by umi without throwing it out, so we can not capture it in our own error boundary
