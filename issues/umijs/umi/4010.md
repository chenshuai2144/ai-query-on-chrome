Qiankun Plugin for umi.js does not support setting 'base' or 'publicPath' in the main application. If the base of the main app is '/app1', then the base of the child app should also be '/app1'. However, when the base of the main app is set, the base of the child app will be converted to double slashes form. It's recommended to change the base configuration of the main app to a relative path from the public path.
