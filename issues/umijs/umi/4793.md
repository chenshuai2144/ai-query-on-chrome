To use PWA on Umi 3.0, follow these steps:

1. Install the `workbox-webpack-plugin` dependency.
2. Configure the PWA in `umirc.js` by adding a `links` array and a `chainWebpack` function.
3. Create a `register-service-worker.js` file with a service worker that registers and handles updates and offline events.
4. Add the service worker to your app by importing it in `global.js`.
5. Verify the PWA by checking the browser's developer tools and the service worker's console and logs.
