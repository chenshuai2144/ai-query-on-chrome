It seems that the issue is related to the use of the `useLocation` hook in Umi. The `query` property of the returned `Location` object is not defined, causing errors when trying to access it.
One possible solution is to add a type definition for the `query` property of the `Location` object. This can be done by creating a type alias for the `query` property and using it in the code.
For example, you can define a type alias like this:

```typescript
type LocationQuery = Record<string, string>;
```

Then, you can use this type alias in your code to define the `query` property of the `Location` object:

```typescript
const location = useLocation<LocationQuery>();
const query = location.query;
```

This should allow you to access the `query` property of the `Location` object without encountering errors.
