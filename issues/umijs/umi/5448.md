This issue appears to be related to the usage of the `@umijs/hooks` package in the provided code snippet. The `getInitialState` function seems to be returning an object with a `settings` property, but the code later expects an object with a `currentUser` property. It's unclear why this difference exists, as the `initialState` definition should match the expected shape of the returned object.
To resolve this issue, it may be necessary to update the definition of `initialState` to include a `currentUser` property and ensure that it is correctly set during the `getInitialState` function.
