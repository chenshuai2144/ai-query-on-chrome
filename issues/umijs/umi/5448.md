This issue seems to be related to the use of the `ProLayout` component in Umi.js. The `onPageChange` method of the `ProLayout` component is not being triggered, which means that the layout is not being updated when the user navigates to a different page. The issue has been reported in the Umi.js repository and is being tracked there.
