# Bug: Cannot update page elements after modifying webpack configuration with chainWebpack

## What Happens:

When modifying the webpack configuration with `chainWebpack`, the page elements cannot be dynamically updated.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Create a new Umi project using `yarn create @umijs/umi-app`.
2. In the `umirc.ts` file, modify the webpack configuration and add a plugin such as `HtmlWebpackPlugin`.
3. Run the project and notice that the page elements are not updated after modifying the configuration.

## Solution:

Do not use `HtmlWebpackPlugin` in the `chainWebpack` configuration. Instead, use the `CopyWebpackPlugin` and `HtmlWebpackTagsPlugin` plugins.
