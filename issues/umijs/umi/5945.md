Bug: Unable to fix port number during `umi dev`. Happens randomly, often using 8001, but sometimes 8000 is used. Expectation: Port should be fixed. Reproducible steps:

1. Run `cross-env PORT=8000 umi dev`
2. Observe that port number changes frequently. Context: - Umi version: N/A - Node version: N/A - Platform: N/A (Please specify if necessary) Source repositories: - [ycjcl868](https://github.com/ycjcl868) - [s97712](https://github.com/s97712) - [TonyMistark](https://github.com/TonyMistark)
   Suggested resolution: Provide a way to fix the port number during `umi dev`.
