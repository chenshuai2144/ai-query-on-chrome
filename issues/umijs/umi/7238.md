"Bug" in Next.js 10.0.5: "Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated. Please run: npx browserslist@latest --update-db" can be fixed by running "npx browserslist@latest --update-db" and then rebuilding. However, if this warning causes build failures in CI/CD, a solution may be to ignore the warning or update to a newer version of Next.js.
