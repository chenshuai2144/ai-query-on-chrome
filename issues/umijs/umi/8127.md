UMI and React versions cause JavaScript errors when combined with MSFU during routing to the next page. The issue appears to occur when upgrading from React 17 to 18 due to chunk loading problems. Downgrade to a previous version of React, use a different state management approach or seek help from the UMI community can resolve the problem.
