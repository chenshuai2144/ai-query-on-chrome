When creating a new umi-project with `npx umi-create@latest` and adding the line `navTheme: 'dark'` to the layout configuration, the change does not take effect.

@ant-design/pro-layout v7 (currently in beta21) no longer supports the `navTheme: 'dark'` property configuration. For custom theme colors, refer to: [https://next-procomponents.ant.design/components/layout#%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87-token-%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E6%A0%B7%E5%BC%8F](https://next-procomponents.ant.design/components/layout#%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87-token-%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E6%A0%B7%E5%BC%8F)

According to the umi official documentation, I created a new project, but it turned out to be a beta version of pro-layout, which caused the configuration options I configured according to the official documentation to be unable to take effect. I suggest updating the official documentation, otherwise the experience is too bad and I dare not use umi.

This is pro team's consideration. If you need navTheme, please switch to @ant-design/pro-layout@6.
