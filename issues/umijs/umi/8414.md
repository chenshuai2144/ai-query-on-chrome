Bug: @unocss/cli is required for unocss to work in umijs 4.0.4. When installing unocss in umijs 4.0.4, the uno.css file is not generated. To reproduce, remove the @unocss/cli dependency and run the project. Context: Umi Version: 4.0.4, Sorrycc: Docs fixed, Xu-Aurora: Followed documentation, unocss still doesn't work, YangJianFei: No documentation found.
