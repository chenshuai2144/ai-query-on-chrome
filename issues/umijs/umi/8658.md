This is a discussion on compatibility issues with legacy browsers for the Umil framework, specifically focusing on two main problems: `esbuild` optimization and Umi 4's default configuration for babel.
The first problem mentioned is that `esbuild` automatically optimizes ES6 code into ES5, causing conflicts when using `targets`. The second issue is that Umi 4 currently only uses Babel to compile packages without babel dependencies, which can cause advanced syntax in some packages to become visible to users after installation.
To address these issues, suggestions have been made to automatically switch between different configurations depending on the target browser, as well as for adjusting the babel configuration based on the user's needs. Another proposal suggests adding an option to specify which files should be excluded from compression by Umi 4.
Other community members have shared their own experiences with compatibility issues with legacy browsers and have offered solutions or suggestions. It has been suggested that users who require compatibility with unsupported browsers may need to manually adjust their project's configuration or use alternative tools.
