Layout configuration in app.tsx causes component rendered in page left corner instead of right upper corner.
In umi4, in app.ts file, I set up the following configuration for the layout plugin:

```typescript
import { Layout } from "umi";

<Layout>
  <div className="rightContentRender">I am a right content render</div>
</Layout>
```

The component I have rendered in the right corner appears on the left lower corner.
This issue occurred with the version of umi4 that I installed, which was 4.0.6. I also used Node.js version 16.
To resolve this issue, I followed these steps:

1. I checked the umi4 documentation and found that there was an option called `rightContentRender`, which determines where the content should be rendered.
2. After reviewing the umi4 source code, I noticed that the `rightContentRender` property was being set correctly in my code.
3. I verified that the umi4 version was not causing any issues by downgrading it to version 3.x.
4. However, even after downgrading the umi4 version, the issue persisted. Therefore, I decided to investigate further.
5. In my project, I noticed that there were two versions of the `@ant-design/pro-layout` package installed. One version was installed globally and another was installed locally.
6. After uninstalling both packages and reinstalling only one of them (either globally or locally), the issue resolved.
7. Finally, I confirmed that the correct umi4 version was being used in my project and that the layout plugin was working as expected.
8. The version of the `@ant-design/pro-layout` package did not affect the layout plugin because the layout plugin does not use any components from the `@ant-design/pro-layout` package directly.
9. Therefore, the product and development teams need to understand that the `rightContentRender` property controls the placement of the right content, not the entire layout of the application.
