## Summary

The problem is that the `umi3` layout route does not work with the `umi4` configuration route. The solution is to manually handle the layout issue in `umi4`, which involves two changes:

1. Use `<Outlet />` in the layout component when using the configuration route, which is the outlet for child routes in `umi4`.
2. Use `wrappers` configuration or patch the client routes in runtime to add the layout component.
