# Bug Report: Ant Design's Menu component's `children` will be removed in the next major version, use `items` instead.

## Minimal Showcase Repository:

- With this repository, you can see the error when hovering over the translation button.
- The project is using Umi version 4.0.15 and Node version 16.15.1 on Windows 10.

## Solution:

- To fix the issue, update to the latest version of Ant Design which has already replaced `children` with `items`.
