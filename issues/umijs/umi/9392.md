UMI4 SSR is not working and is incompatible with SVG. The issue can be reproduced by running `yarn start` in the repository provided in the issue. The error message is "Do not know how to load path: svgAssets:/sandbox/src/pages/@/assets/images/404.svg". This error is caused by the fact that UMI4 is still in beta and may not be fully stable. The solution is to use an earlier version of UMI, such as UMI3.
