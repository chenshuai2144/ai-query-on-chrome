The issue is that the `umi max` package conflicts with the `tailwindcss` library when both are used together in an Ant Design Pro project. A minimal reproduction repository can be found at <https://github.com/TanGuangZhi/ReactLearn>. The solution is to disable the `preflight` option in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
