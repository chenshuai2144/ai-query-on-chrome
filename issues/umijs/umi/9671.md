Bug: Error when calling `applyPlugins()` in `request.ts` for AntD Pro V5 with Yarn deploy.
Steps to reproduce:

- Clone the provided SudokuMasterV3 repository.
- Run `yarn start:dev` to start the development server.
- Navigate to the login page.
- Enter your credentials and click on "Login".
- Error message: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'applyPlugins').

This issue can be reproduced by attempting to deploy an AntD Pro V5 application using Yarn deploy. The `applyPlugins()` method in the `request.ts` file returns an empty `pluginManager` object, causing an error when trying to access its properties.
