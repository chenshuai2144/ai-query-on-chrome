It seems that you are trying to use the `umi openapi` command to generate OpenAPI documentation for your Umi project, but you are encountering an error message that says "Invalid command openapi, it's not registered." This error message suggests that the `umi openapi` command is not recognized by your Umi project.
One possible solution to this issue is to add the `umi-openapi` plugin to your project's configuration. To do this, you can add the following line to your project's `umi.config.js` file:

```javascript
plugins: ["umi-openapi"];
```

Once you have added this line to your `umi.config.js` file, you should be able to use the `umi openapi` command to generate OpenAPI documentation for your project without encountering the "Invalid command openapi, it's not registered" error message.
If you continue to encounter issues with the `umi openapi` command, you may want to try using the `max openapi` command instead. To do this, you can add the following line to your project's `umi.config.js` file:

```javascript
plugins: ["max-openapi"];
```

Once you have added this line to your `umi.config.js` file, you should be able to use the `max openapi` command to generate OpenAPI documentation for your project.
