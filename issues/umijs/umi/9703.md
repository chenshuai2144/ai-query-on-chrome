The error message says "Invalid command openapi, it's not registered". This means that the "openapi" command is not recognized by the current project configuration. It is possible that this command is not included in the list of commands that can be executed for this particular project or it is missing from the package.json file.
To resolve this issue, you should check your project configuration and make sure that the correct version of the "openapi" plugin is installed. You may also need to update the dependencies in your package.json file to include the latest version of the "openapi" plugin. Additionally, you could try manually adding the plugin to the list of enabled plugins in your project configuration.
