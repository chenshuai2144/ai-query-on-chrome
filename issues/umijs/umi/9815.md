# Bug: colorPrimary not working in antd5.0

In antd5.0, the `colorPrimary` configuration is not working. The button only changes its normal state color, but it still turns blue when hovered. To fix this issue, you can try importing the `ConfigProviderProps` from `antd/es/config-provider` and adding a theme object with a `colorPrimary` token set to `red`.
